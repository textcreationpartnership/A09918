         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:13650:6"/>ſtande vpon the multitude eyther of foes or fauourers. For neither are we ſo much vnſkilfull of the ſtate of men, or vnmindefull of the very wordes of Chriſte, that wée ſhould forget that there haue bene euer moe founde who haue withſtoode the truth, than defended it. Thou truely, as I perceyue, bethinkyng thy ſelfe of ſome wiſe preface, haſte choſen that one, whiche did moſte accorde with thy nature and inclination: for ſo almoſte it falleth amongſt men, eſpecially of guiltie conſciences, that they déeme o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by their owne diſpoſition. Therefore bycauſe thou (ſhrowding thy ſelfe as it were vnder the ſhadowe of thy pretended modeſtie) doſt of olde ayme at this marke, that the moſte may thinke thée ſome body, haſte in déede dée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that we are grieued with the ſame infirmitie, and therfore that thou couldſt not worke vs a greater diſpite, than if with a certaine ſottiſhe kinde of chattering thou mighteſt pretend to haue done this as bewayling our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie, &amp; carefull for the defence of our cauſe, thou ſhouldeſt friendly &amp; familiarly write vnto vs. But in déede we mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel that any man ſo practiſed in deceit, could ſo forget him ſelf, as not to think that men would ſtraight enquire how it could be, that in ſo waightie a matter writing ſo famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly to thy friends, thou ſhouldſt ſuppreſſe thy name.

And thou art the very man (albeit this time hath others) whoſe protection if the truth require it,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:13650:6"/>ſhould do in ſuch ſort, as if the improuident ſhéepe ſhould thinke them ſelues in ſafetie under the defence of ſome gréedie Wolfe.

But in déede is this the way and meane to eſtabliſhe one doctrine, to reporte the worde of God to be ſo doubtfull and vncertayne, that which way ſoeuer thou takeſt it, it ſuffiſeth not to decide the controuerſies of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and we muſt looke for ſome other newe reuelation from heauen: For thou mayſt eaſily recount all theſe, ſith thou haſte ſo often written them. Away with this hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie: why commeſt thou not out of thy lurking corners? why doſte thou hyde thy name? why doſte thou not bidde open warre to the trueth? For truely thou canſt not now be vnknowen: and though it be agaynſt our willes, thine obſtinacie will bring to paſſe that we ſhall name thée.</p>
               <p>Thou requireſt of vs proofes that the people may vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande. We aunſwere, that we profeſſe that doctrine whiche can ſéeme to the worlde nothing but fooliſhneſſe,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:13650:7"/>And howe true this aunſwere is, we may very well ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the example of Chriſt himſelfe. For except he ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfie thée, whom may we thinke ſhall? But thou muſte néedes confeſſe that thoſe people did very little profite in his doctrine, which continually followed him, when thoſe twelue his deareſt familiar friends, to whome he impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his ſecrete myſteries, when he their maſter was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to aſcende into heauen, ſéemed not ſufficiently to haue knowen what is the nature of his kingdome.</p>
               <p>But I knowe where vpon thou ſtandeſt. Bicauſe thou haſte read that the wiſedome of God is hidde from the wiſe and prudent of this worlde, therefore howe muche the more any man is vnſkilfull of good artes &amp; diſcipline, ſo muche the rather thou déemeſt him worthy to be iudge of diuine myſteries. Thou therfore moſt alloweſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mind of the multitude, and I know not what vulgar kinde of proofe doth beſt pleaſe thée: for neither doeſt thou it (as I thinke) as if thou diddeſt in déede beléeue it were ſo, but that in déede thou mayeſt knowe more to deceyue the vnſkilfull &amp; common multitude. But if thou art ignorant <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, the wiſedome of the fleſhe is the very thing that letteth vs to ſée the light of God: neither is it only in thoſe wiſe men, but in euery one. Who ſoeuer is ſubiect to this diſeaſe (as all be that are not renued of the ſpirite) thou laboureſt in vayne to teache him the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of Chriſtian Religion, whether thou ſhouldſt maffle with the multitude, or laboureſt to be wiſe with the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that is, to doate of purpoſe. We muſt receiue theſe things by fayth. But fayth is the gift of God, &amp; compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth arguments not deuiſed of our owne brayne, but take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of the word of God: which if thou doſt not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, ther is yet no cauſe why thou ſhouldſt blame the too much darkenes of things, or require more perſpicuitie in Caluin, or any other. Thou thy ſelfe haſt within thée that

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſelfloue, this pride doth blinde thée, howſoeuer thou doeſt ſhadow theſe with a certaine falſe counterfayte of libertie and ſimplicitie. Giue glory to God, &amp; pray him hartely that he will open thine eyes: then ſhalt thou proue thoſe arguments to be both playne, euident and neceſſarie, whiche now thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proueſt as weake and beggerly. Thou ſaydeſt before that thou hadſt determined to deale of that one argument of Deſtinie, or Predeſtination. We truly who haue long ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thence much hearde thée to be out of meaſure impudent, and by experience knowe it to be ſo, doe yet maruell that thine impudencie could be ſo great, that thou durſt obiect to Caluine that hatefull name of Deſtinie: wherof what he hath tofore written, it ſhall not repent vs to ſet downe in his owne wordes, both bicauſe, albeit thou arte full of enuie, they are excellently, plainely, learnedly and godly written: &amp; alſo that by the entrance, euery one may know, with what faithfull minde thou vndertookeſt this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Thus therfore ſaith Caluine: <q>Thoſe that endeuour to worke deſpite to this doctrine, doe falſly vrge that it is the Stoickes opinion of Deſtinie:<note place="margin">Chryſ. Iuſt. cap. 14. par. 40.</note> whiche alſo was obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to Auguſtine in his time. Albeit we contende of wordes againſt our will, yet we admitte not in any wiſe the name of Deſtinie, bothe bycauſe of that kinde whoſe prophane ſtraungneſſe Paule hath taught vs to auoyde, and alſo bicauſe they indeuour to burthen Gods truthe with the hatred of it.</q> Theſe hath Caluine written in ſo many words, which if thou diddeſt not know, what raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is it to reproue that thou kneweſt not? but if in déede thou diddeſt, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what impudencie was it to charge him with that crime whiche thy ſelfe kneweſt to be falſe?
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:13650:8"/>
                  <q>But here I will pleaſure thée. For thou wilt ſay it is not Deſtinie in name, but in effect. It is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o. Heare therefore what in the ſame place he adioyneth: The very opinion of the Stoiks (ſayth he) is falſly &amp; malitiouſly obiected vnto vs. For we deuiſe not with the Stoicks a neceſſitie of the perpetuall bonde of cauſes, and of a certaine intricate or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which is contemned in nature: but we determine God the arbiter and moderator of all things, who in his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall wiſedome hath before all worldes decreed that hée would doe, and now in his power acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pliſheth that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, wherevpon we affirme that not onely heauen and earth and inſenſible creatures, but alſo the purpoſes and myndes of men to be ſo gouerned by his prouidence, that they are brought to that ende whiche is determined of the ſame.</q> And then he addeth, by what meanes if thou ſhouldeſt conſider the ſeconde cauſes by themſelues, any thyng may come bothe at aduenture, and vnlooked for. Whiche diſputations if thou vnderſtandeſt not, thou oughteſt to blame thy ſelfe, who at the leaſt knoweſt not by <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Plutarche;</hi> what was the controuerſie of <hi>Chryſippus</hi> and <hi>Diodorus.</hi> But what of theſe? verily that all may ſée howe muche credite is to be gyuen to that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer, whiche ſo ſhamefully lyeth in the very begyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng, ſaying that euery and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> very worſte in that part of their ſpeache are wonte to pretende ſome ſhewe of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtie. For that whiche concerneth the matter it ſelfe wée will further examine in his place. At laſte thou ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt that wherein veryly thou haſte excéeded thy ſelfe, and in déede thou ſéemeſt to haue well obſerued this princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Rothorique, that thoſe thyngs whiche wée would moſte firmely ſhoulde bée kepte in minde with the audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, may bée ſpoken in the laſte place. There are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried aboute (thou ſayeſt) of this argument certaine Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:13650:8"/>gathered out of thy bookes which I will tumultuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſette downe. And, is it ſo, a greate chaunter of the truthe, that thou ſhouldeſt take ſuche paynes to make tumultes in the Churche of GOD? Is it ſo, (I ſay) waſte thou not well in thy wittes, that thou ſhouldeſt forgette to aſke of theſe rogues, that carrie aboute theſe Slaunders, whether they woulde firſte with ſufficient witneſſes proue theſe thyngs they caried, to be true? For tell mée what wouldeſt thou anſwere if I ſhoulde one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay that all theſe are falſe whiche are obiected againſt Caluine. Truely thou wouldeſt eyther ſuddenly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe thy ſelfe a falſe accuſer, whiche thou clokeſt as well as thou canſte: or truely thou wouldeſt be conſtrayned thy ſelfe to accuſe thyne owne fooliſhneſſe, whiche wilt thynke that thou oughteſt to inquyre whether the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation were iuſte or vniuſte, then whether it were true or falſe. And in déede, as thou ſhalte ſhortly vnderſtand, the moſte parte of theſe Articles (as thou calleſt them) is ſuche ſtuffe, that bare deniall is ſufficient.</p>
               <p>But goe too, that great care to reconcile the Churche hath euen nouriſht thée. And thoſe that knowe thée ſay thou arte a ſimple man, ſo that often tymes thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt not whether thou ſpeake with or agaynſt thy ſelfe, therefore in déede it ſhall not bée amiſſe that wée beare with thy infirmitie of nature. Moreouer thou beyng ſo good a manne and ſo muche our friende, thou couldeſt not chooſe but bée muche chaffed when thou heardeſt thoſe Churches wherein thou haſte bene nouriſhed, and thoſe menne whoſe liberalitie hath long done thée good, to be charged with ſuch impietie. Therfore thou diddeſt that is too muche proper to fumiſhe men, ſodaynly to ſette thy ſelf to ſhuffle in our cauſe: and when thou hadſt no ſufficient defence, thou wouldeſt certifie vs of the whole mater. So it is, that the greateſt matter eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped

Againe the Apoſtle ſought not ſtarting hooles, as if he were taken tardie, but ſhewed that the conſideration of Gods Diuine iuſtice is more ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne than that it may either be meaſured after any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne

                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe ſayth Caluine, and many others euery where of lyke ſorte, whereof (I ſay) it may be eaſily gathered that it is Slander ouſly ſpoken of thée whatſoeuer thou ſpeakeſt of the bare determination of God. For they call that a bare determination whereby any thing is ſo done, that no regarde be had whether it be iuſte or vniuſte that is done.</p>
                  <p>We therefore doe in déede confeſſe with Paule that al things are done by purpoſe of the Deuine will, that whome he will before they be borne, or euer they haue done eyther good or euill, he eyther loueth or hateth: and therefore in his time eyther pitieth or hardeneth: but we adde this, that this notwithſtanding, there is no iniuſtice with God, that he whiche dothe ſo decrée theſe things, dothe notwithſtandying that whiche is altogither righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous. And this we proue by many reaſons. Firſte by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that the will of God is the ſoueraigne rule of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice: neyther is it a good conſequent that that is vniuſt, bycauſe mans reaſon ſeeth no cauſe of ſuch Iuſtice. For what? doth not the ſunne ſhyne, bicauſe the blinde is ſtill in darkeneſſe? Againe, we ſay they deale fooliſhly, who holde that any thing is good in it ſelfe before God will haue it ſo: ſeyng that contrarily, it is requiſite that God will anything to be iuſte before it can be ſo. For the will of God dependeth not of the qualitie of things: but the contrary, the qualitie of things by order of cauſes doth folowe the will of God. Thirdly wée adde alſo that in ſuche decrée whereby God from the beginnyng determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned whatſoeuer vaſſals of his wrath he woulde, that the execution of his purpoſe muſte be diſtinguiſhed from the purpoſe it ſelfe, that is the purpoſe of reiectyng from dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Wée vnderſtande no other cauſe of the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:13650:10"/>than the very will of GOD, whiche can not bée but altogyther moſte iuſte, albeit the blynde wyſedome of the fleſhe thynketh otherwiſe. But the cauſes of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, that is damnation, the Lorde hath plentyfully and playnely ſhewed vs, euen the voluntary corruption of Adam deriued vnto vs, and the fruyctes of that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. But here agayne mans reaſon inforceth it ſelfe. Whence (ſayth it) be the cauſes of this damnation? haue they ſo come to paſſe agaynſt the will of GOD? no forſoothe: for then hée ſhoulde not bée Almightie. Therefore with hys will, for he dothe not ſuffer vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, and that is the opinion of Epicures, to ordayne a careleſſe foreknowledge of GOD, whiche is eaſily ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen by infinite teſtimonies of Scripture.</p>
                  <p>But if hée haue decreed theſe things to be ſo, and I coulde not reſiſte hys will, am not I blameleſſe of that faulte whiche altogither reſteth in hym? And this is that greate doubte whiche no man vnderſtandeth, ſaue thoſe who out of hys worde haue learned to thynke reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently of GOD. Therefore Paule, when he commeth to thys poynte, denieth not that it was the will of God, whiche the wicked coulde not reſiſte: but their collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this approued principle, hée vtterly denieth, bycauſe GOD can not bée vniuſte: and hée recalleth vs to the conſideration of mannes eſtate, that wée mighte re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence ſo highe a myſterie, not that wée ſhoulde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue it. But in déede you are wyſer than the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, for thou takeſt theſe thyngs not to haue come to paſſe by the will of GOD, but if it bée ſo, then is it maruell that the Apoſtle dyd not remember it, that he mighte haue anſwered the very ſelfe thing. Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doeſt thou conſider all this whyle whether thys raſhneſſe dothe headlong inforce thée truely to this poynt, that thou mayſt more &amp; more incomber thy ſelfe, whyleſt
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:13650:11"/>thou thinkeſt that thou canſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehende the infinite wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God. For that we may yéelde thée that thou ſéekeſt, that the cauſes of damnation doe chaunce with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any determination of God, ſée how many and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked abſurdities may follow. For firſte if they chaunce agaynſt his will thou denieſt the Omnipotencie of God, who coulde not withſtande that, whiche he woulde. But if in déede thou ſayſt he wincketh at it, howe muche doeſt thou differ from Epicuriſme? It remayneth then that he permitteth it willingly, and there is one and the ſame difficultie. For if thou ſayeſt that eyther our ſinnes foreknowen or already committed haue giuen occaſion to this will, thou ſayeſt nothyng. For we ſéeke the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall of theſe ſinnes, that is, the cauſes of corruption, from whiche thou canſte no more ſeclude the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, than when there is queſtion of the fruictes of corruption, ſeing that here alſo the ſame inconueniences doe accomber thée, and thou arte taken in the ſame La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byrinth. Furthermore, ſée howe well thou defendeſt Gods Iuſtice. For truely that whiche he hath ſuffered, albeit he hath not determined it, (for we will giue thée ſo muche) yet he coulde haue letted it euen with a becke: Why therfore did he not ſuppreſſe Sathan in tyme? why dyd he not thorowly eſtabliſh Adam and Eue? or if thou liſt not looke backe vnto them, why did he not commanund the fountayne of ſinne to ſtay in Adam, that it ſhould not iſſue out vpon his poſteritie? was it bicauſe the ſinnes of his poſteritie deſerued it?</p>
                  <p>But they ſhoulde haue had no ſinne, if corruption had not bene inlarged. But why dothe he dayly gyue Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than ſuche libertie whiche he can reſtrayne? truly where ſoeuer thou turneſt thée, humane reaſon ſheweth vs this, that he is equally in fault, who when he can preuent one from fallyng to deſtruction, yet doth it not, with him that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:13650:11"/>throweth him downe headlong. Therefore although that thy ſolution ſhould be of force, humaine reaſon ſhould not ſurceaſe to déeme God vniuſt. But thou wilt ſay: Theſe things are curious. They are in déede, and therefore we thinke it ſacriledge for any vnreuerently to attempt theſe high myſteries of God. But we ſay that that is curious and wicked too, to demaunde howe God ſhoulde be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fault, if he ordayne the cauſes of damnation. Whiche queſtion thou haſte vndertooke to diſſolue: but we thinke with the Apoſtle that it is altogether impoſſible with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine ſenſes to be expreſſed, which is curious, which is paſſing wicked, which ſéeketh the ſecret myſteries of God without his worde. Is it thou which ſéekeſt a reaſon of the Diuine wiſedome, and therefore willingly and of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe runneſt headlong into daunger? or I? who when we come to Gods will, béeing mindefull of mans imbecilitie, do ſecretly reuerence the maieſtie of god. Therfore that I may briefly ſay this, let this be the furtheſt reach of mans iudgement: although the cauſe of his decrée is vnſerchea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, whereby God hath determined from euerlaſting to create many, in whoſe iuſt damnation he might manyfeſt the glorie of his iuſtice, and for that cauſe whoſoeuer are appoynted vnto death, cannot but periſhe in their tyme, yet that God, becauſe he damneth none but the corrupt and guyltie, is therefore without all blame of their dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, as he who rightly decerneth thoſe things whiche men doe vniuſtly, and therefore iuſtly puniſheth. But if humayne reaſon can not endure it, yet it doth not followe that it is otherwiſe. Rather let whatſoeuer is fleſhe giue place, (for ſo I had rather than ſpeake as thou doeſt) that we may wholly repoſe our ſelues in the worde of God. But thou wilt ſay, Where is the worde of God? Surely thou canſt not denie, except thou wilt adde ſomewhat to thine vnmeaſurable impudencie, that in teaching theſe
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:13650:12"/>things, we haue as it were perſiſted in the ſteps of Paul. But we ſhall ſée more of this when we ſhall deale with thée hande to hande. Now I ſhall diſcharge my dutie, if I ſhall euidently lay open to all Readers thine intollerable impudencie in deuiſing theſe deteſtable Slaunders. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that I may returne thither whence I haue digreſſed, I will further auouch two places out of Caluine agaynſt thy ſlaunders.<note place="margin">In his boke of eternall Predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> For thus he ſayth: <q>Albeit before the fal of Adam God for ſecrete cauſes had determined what he would do, yet do we reade in Scripture that he conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>neth nothing but ſinne.<note place="margin">Eſa. 23. b. 9.</note> So it remaineth that he had iuſt cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to reiect ſome, but vnknowen to vs: and he hateth or condemneth in man nothing but that which is not agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with his iuſtice. Agayne he ſayth, Let vs learne that we ought ſo to conſider the Prouidence of God, that we may geue glory and prayſe to his omnipotencie. For the wiſdome and iuſtice of God is euer to be ioyned with his power. Like as therfore the Scriptures do teach, that the Lord in his iuſtice &amp; wiſedome doth this or that, ſo teache they a certayne ende for which he doth <hi>this or that.</hi> For that fayned deuiſe of the abſolute power of God, whiche the Scholemen inferre, is an execrable blaſphemie. For it is as much as if they ſhould ſay that god were ſome tyrant, determining what he liſt without equitie. Their Scholes are full of ſuche blaſphemies: neither are they vnlike the Ethnicks, who helde that God did dally in mens matters. But we are taught in the ſchole of Chriſt, that the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of God doth ſhine in his workes, of what ſorte ſoeuer they be, that all mouthes may be ſtopped, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie giuen to him alone.</q> Doſte thou (Sycophant) at the laſt acknowledge howe muche thine impudencie was in theſe patched Articles? Thou haſt further added other ſlaunders. For firſt, for that which Caluine hath ſaid, that ſome me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are reiected for iuſte cauſe, but to vs vnknowne,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:13650:12"/>thou making no me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion of any cauſe, ſayſt that we teach, that the greateſt part of men are created to damnation. But yet we will not ſtriue of the number, for we knowe by the Scriptures, and the continuall experience of all ages, that the moſt do enter by the brode gate which lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to deſtruction: yet notwithſtanding doſte not thou ſurceaſe to be a ſlaunderer, who in accuſing doeſt adde ſomewhat of thine owne. Then (wherein thy wickednes doth moſt appeare) thou ſo writeſt theſe things as if we ſhould ſay, that the ende of the creation of Reprobates is their eternall damnation: which ſlaunder I thus refell with the very words of Caluine.<note place="margin">Inſt. Chriſt. cap. 14. ſect. 17.</note> 
                     <q>It ought to be knowen (ſayth he) among all men, that Salomon ſayth, that God hath created all things for him ſelfe, euen the wicked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt the day of euill. Beholde, ſéeing the diſpoſition of all things is in the hande of God, ſéeing the determination of life and death remayneth in him, and ſo at his will and pleaſure ordeineth that among men ſome euen from their mothers wombe ſhould be vndoubtedly giuen ouer vnto death, who ſhould glorifie his name in their deſtruction.</q> Therefore that we may briefly conclude, Caluine thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not that the Reprobate are therefore ſimply created that they ſhoulde periſh, but that periſhing in their owne defaulte, they might aduaunce the Iuſtice of God. And further, that their perdition ſo dependeth of the Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of God, that the whole matter and cauſe of their damnation be founde in them ſelues: and albeit it is <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible to humaine ſenſes,</hi> yet that it is the iuſt deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of God.</p>
                  <p>Why therefore doeſt thou wickedly and maliciouſly leaue vntouched all that whiche is ſpoken of the fault of them that periſhe, and the glory of God? But go too, let vs heare with what ſounde Arguments thyſelfe canſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne thine owne ſlaunder.</p>

                        <hi>FIRST</hi> of all (I ſay) thou doſt vnwiſely in this place, to diſpute eyther of the loue or hatred of God towardes men. For neither is it demaunded héere whether he hath hated any, but whether he hath reiected any. Which two béeing diuerſe, thou notwithſtanding haſte déemed one. I will ſpeake more playnely, that thou mayſte not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playne of obſcuritie. We ſay that there is an aſſured or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of cauſes ordeyned of the Lorde, notwithſtanding he at once beholdeth all things as preſent, yet hath he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſome cauſes in order to ſuccéede, and ſome to goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: which order of cauſes alſo the Philoſophers haue acknowledged, and haue called <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap> ſucceſſion by turne. We affirme therefore that the hatred of God in reiecting of men in the order of cauſes, hath not procée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the eternall decrée of God, (as that whiche of right we place in the higheſt degrée of all cauſes,) but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:13650:13"/>to ſuccéede. So it is, that albeit whomſoeuer the Lord from euerlaſting doth predeſtinate to deſtruction, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde in his tyme he hateth: yet to Predeſtinate to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, is not to hate, but to giue them ouer to his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred. But therewithall when the Lorde appoynteth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death whome he liſteth, he alſo ordereth the cauſes of hys iuſte hatred to come, that the whole matter of his hatred remayne in the menne them ſelues decréed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and therefore hys Iuſtice to ſhyne in them to be proſecuted with hatred, and laſtely to be damned. But thou arte deceyued in that, whiche déemeſt that God dothe firſte hate anye man before he aſſigne him vnto death. Whiche is as fooliſhe as if thou ſhouldeſt ſay, that he firſte beginneth to hate before he haue determined whome he wyll hate. Therefore I coulde at one worde conclude wyth thée, that we thus farre agrée, that we bothe confeſſe, that God hateth and condemneth nothing in men but guyltineſſe and ſinne: but that we diſagrée in this, that thou ſuppoſeſt the hatred of God to be the cauſe why he decreeth ſome to deſtruction: and we ſay that that hatred is not the cauſe of the ſacred decrée, but the effect.</p>
                     <p>Neyther dothe it preiudice vs, that Paule alleaging the wordes of Malachie, I haue hated Eſau, ſéemeth to take hatred for the eternall decrée of reiecting. For I ſay, this worde (I haue hated) in that place declareth nothing, but, I haue decréeed to hate: ſéeing Paule in that place diſputeth of the decrée of God, and not of the execution of the ſayde decrée.

                        </hi> that is to ſay, for as muche as he was preordayned before the worlde was made, whiche was perfourmed in the laſte tymes, as Peter him ſelfe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth. <hi>1. <hi>Peter.</hi> 1. <hi>d.</hi> 20.</hi> But why doth the Scripture ſpeake ſo?

                     <p>Then if theſe things ſhoulde be ſo, that is, if GOD for the foreknowen corruption ſhoulde hate any of hys workes before he had ordeyned them to deſtruction, wherefore was it néedefull for Paule to crye oute:<note place="margin">Rom. 9. d. 20. and. 11 d 33.</note> O man, who arte thou whiche pleadeſt agaynſt God. &amp;c.

But God forbyd that we ſhoulde vſe anye aunſwere ſo abſurde, fooliſhe, and eſtraunged from the nature of God.

But if this be true, what remayneth that eythèr none ſhall be damned, or elſe that thoſe ſhoulde periſhe whome God loueth? For if thou doſte except, that God dothe hate them in the ende for their ſinne, and whom he loued from the beginning, thou ſhalt runne headlong into an other great downefall. For true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if hée did loue, he would alſo ſaue. Why therefore doth he not ſaue?

For the Prophete dealeth not there of the vniuerſall creation of all menne, but of the onely renewing of his Churche, that is, of the frée adoption of the Electe in Chriſte. What impudencie therefore is it, to applie that to creation which is ſpoken of adoption? and to enforce that to all men, that onely appertayneth to the Elect, that thou mayſt communicate the peculiar grace of the Elect with the Reprobates and Baſtards. But thou wilt ſay, Who is father of the reſte? Verely euen he whome Chriſte hath named, when ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to thoſe counterfaits &amp; baſtardly children: You are (ſayth he) of your father the diuell. Nor is there cauſe why therefore thou ſhouldeſt exclaime that I am a Manichée. For I refer this increaſe of children of the Deuill,<note place="margin">Ioh. 8. f. 44</note> not in reſpect of creation, but in reſpect of their depraued nature, whiche God ſo ordayned, that he be not Author thereof,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:13650:15"/>but rather the Diuel, and the will of man which willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hath depraued it ſelfe. Thou wilt ſay therefore in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of creation he in lyke caſe is their father. I graunt it: thou wilt adde therefore he loueth. But that I vtterly denie, and I will by and by proue it to be falſe. But nowe onely I demaunde how aptly thou haſte recited the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Prophete: Then what madneſſe this is, to eſtéeme that what ſoeuer God hath giuen to liuing crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, is in God himſelfe? In déede it is very wonderful, that thou proueſt nothing that the rude multitude alow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, except thou alſo fayneſt y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God hath head, armes, hands, &amp; a wombe too. It is maruell but that thou déemeſt he doth in déede here ſée, deſire meate and digeſte (as ſome haue tryfled of the Starres) or at the leaſt to muſe, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute, to couet, and to chaufe: yea, but thou wilte ſay, I ſpeake onely of thoſe things which belong to God. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou oughtſt to haue defined what thoſe things were. And albeit thou ſhouldſt change thy ſelf into euery ſhape, thou ſhalte neuer finde any thyng attributed to liuyng creatures, whiche may in lyke ſenſe be auouched of God. Yet I confeſſe that the Scripture (ſuch is the goodneſſe of God) dothe oftentymes lyke a nourſe as it were maffle with vs: but yet ſo that it obſerueth a certayne choyſe. Wherfore in lyke caſe thou oughteſt to haue bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded thy ſimilitude with his limites. I alſo graunt that, <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap> that naturall affections in the nature of things, and eſpecially in men, are great arguments of Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. But yet who will graunt thée (except he be madde,) that God loueth thoſe whome he dothe loue, none other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, than men loue one another? Sée euen of thyne owne examples how falſe and fooliſh this is: whiche of vs would haue chyldren borne to him like Toades, Snakes, or ſpiders? But al theſe, (if it be lawful to ſpeake as thou doeſt) the Lorde doth dayly bryng foorth: neyther is there
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:13650:16"/>any creature, whiche for hys wonderfull goodneſſe he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth not.

Therevpon the Diſciples aſke when they ſée the blynde man, who hath ſinned, he? or his parents, that hée ſhoulde be borne blynde. Ieſus anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that neyther hée, nor his parents ſinned: that is, that he was borne blynd, neyther for his own ſins nor for hys parentes? but that the workes of God might be manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in him. What ſayeſt thou to this goodman? heare that your outſcape of foreſéene ſinnes hath failed thée: and ſome Phiſition might be déemed a cruell Father, whiche I ſay not, ſhould wounde his ſonne, but alſo (that I may ſpeake as you doe) ſhoulde ſuffer his Sonne to be woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that by the curyng thereof he mighte gette a name.

                     <p>I come to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other like ſottiſh writing, I wil vſe no har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſpeach. <hi>All men</hi> (thou ſayeſt) <hi>are the iſſue of God: bycauſe God is the father of Adam, of whome all men are borne, therefore God loueth all men.</hi> Firſt I anſwere, that thou doſt againſt the rule of Scripture, which doeſt confuſedly attribute to God, the name of Father, and that ſummarilye in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of all men, that is, whiche alſo communicateſt that whiche is onely proper to one Churche in Chriſte with ſtraungers. That place in déede of Malachie is very vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitly applied of many to the generall procreation of all men, when it is rather referred to one publique father of Iſraell, whether Abraham or Iacob, as appéereth by a lyke place of Moſes. But leaſt I ſéeme to contende for wordes, (albeit the controuerſie is not in vayne) the Lord created all men in Adam, and let him be in this poynt the vniuerſall father of all. If this be reaſon good inough to proue that God ſhould loue al men, how is it that contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rywiſe the Apoſtle ſheweth al in Adam to be the Sonnes of wrath and death, and therefore of hatered? wilt thou
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:13650:17"/>anſwere that the Apoſtle beholdeth all men as they are corrupted in Adam, and therefore abiected? Be it ſo, for ſo it is in déede. But howe doeſt thou beholde them? as yet beyng in Adam? no in déede, in that thou ſayeſt not that God was, but is the Father of all, nor to haue lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, but to loue all. Thou muſte therefore ſéeke ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther outſcape, verily euen this, as thou mayſte ſay that GOD neuertheleſſe loueth all, bycauſe he offereth hys grace to all. But if this be ſo in déede, the foreſéene cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption hath not cauſed that the Lorde ſhoulde reiect ſome, ſeyng he loueth all notwithſtandyng they are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupte, that hée offereth them the fauour of lyfe: and that ſo that hée giueth them grace, to receyue grace offered, (bycauſe that otherwayes the Lorde ſhould ſéeme to vs, as I afterwardes ſhall ſpeake in his place, not to deale faythfully with menne.) But furthermore it ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to conioyne contumacie with corruption, that is, furthermore to refuſe grace offered.

Therfore of foreſéene corruption, or incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulitie, or foreknowen ſinnes it is a fooliſh inuention: and therfore it is néedeful that thou confeſſe this difference to depend of the will of God, albeit the reaſon of this iuſtice is vnknowen to men. Lette vs ſet downe an other more manifeſt example: God is indifferently the father of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſau and Iacob, and that not onely in Adam, but alſo in Iſaac, with whom he made a couenaunt of peculiar bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. But wilt thou dare affirme, that God is no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes the Father of Eſau than of Iacob? for we would graunt thée this that Eſau may haue God his father: if thou dareſt affirme this, the Lorde from heauen ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell thée, crying, the elder ſhall ſcrue the yonger: and leaſt thou mayſt wrangle that this is to be vnderſtande of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery ſeruitude, the Lorde is yet agaynſt thée, teſtifying that the excellencie of Iacob was ioyned with bys loue, and the reprobation of Eſau with his hatered: whereof it was an aſſured ſigne, that he loſte the promiſſe of the lande of Canaan, ſeyng that was the earneſt of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly bleſſyng and adoption. It remayneth then that we graunt thée that God alſo loued Eſau as a Father, yet that he loued Iacob far otherwayes. But tel me, whence is this differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,<note place="margin">Rom. 9. c. 25</note> but of him that pitieth whom he pleaſeth, and hardneth whome hée will as the Apoſtle ſaith? For if thou returneſt to the foreknowen frowardneſſe of Eſau, the Apoſtle reſiſteth, who, hauing called Iacob beloued, and therefore elect before he was borne, that we might knowe election, not onely in tyme (as that which is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall) but alſo in the order of cauſes to preuent all things,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:13650:18"/>and ſo that vtterly no place be left for foreſight, for faith or works, as thoſe whiche are not cauſes, but fruites of election: So when he commeth to the oppoſite member, he vtterly ſheweth by the like reaſon, that Eſau was ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and therefore vowed to deſtruction before he was borne, or had done any evill. That verely we alſo maye vnderſtande in this behalfe not onely an eternall purpoſe of reiecting, but that it is ſuperiour to all cauſes of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. And that héere is lefte no place to foreſight, or corruption, or incredulitie, or of euill workes. For theſe in déede be cauſes of damnation, ſo onely adherent to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſau, that God by no meanes be guyltie of the cryme, but yet are they cauſes of the eternall decrée of Reprobation, not for going, but folowing. Other wiſe if theſe wordes of Paule, Before they were borne, &amp; or euer they had done good or euill, you doe otherwiſe in one parte expounde than in another, ouer and beſide that generall principle, that contraries haue all one diſcipline, ſhall plentifully refell thée: there is none who wyll not ſée that appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant force is offered to the Apoſtles wordes, if one and the ſame ſentence, and in the ſelfe wordes, ſhould be rac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked into diuers expoſitions. Which in déede ſhall be, if in one parte you ſay that foreſight is excluded, and in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther notwithſtanding reſerued. Finally, if the purpoſe of reiecting ſhoulde haue ſtoode vpon foreſight, ouer and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that the ſelfe things of neceſſitie muſte haue béene foreſéene on both partes, whence at the laſt the obiections whiche folowe ſhoulde haue ſprong, in foredoing of which the Apoſtle ſo forceably contendeth. For neither ſhould the Elect haue had whereof to complayne, except they would complayne of mercie: nor alſo the reprobate, if for their foreſéene deſertes they had bene reiected. But it is one thyng to aſke why God hath hated, an other thing to aſke why he hath Predeſtinate to hatered. All whiche
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:13650:19"/>leaſt happily thou thinkeſt I haue deuiſed, heare what Auguſtine hath thought of the ſame matter in his <hi>Enchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridion</hi> to <hi>Laurentius, Cap. <hi>98.</hi>

(ſayth he) is there iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie with God? God forbydde. For it ſéemeth an vniuſte thing, that without the merite of good or euyll works, God loueth one, and hateth another. In whiche thing if God would the workes to come, eyther good of this, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil of that to come, to be vnderſtoode, as he did foreknow them, he would not haue ſayde of workes, but of workes to come, and ſo haue diſſolued this queſtion: yea he would haue giuen no queſtion néedefull to be diſſolued. Theſe Auguſtine.</p>
                     <p>It remayneth therefore, that albeit if God maye be ſayde indifferently to be the Father of all men in Adam, yet can it not be ſayde indifferently that he loueth men, yea, nor that he loueth all men: and therefore that all this thy reaſoning is vayne and fooliſhe, becauſe the purpoſe of God ſtandeth not in the loue or hatred from this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon benefite of creation, but of the eternall, and albeit ſecrete, yet the moſte righteous will of God.</p>

And then we ſhewe that, that God is not moued with the hatered of any, that he ſhould vowe him to deſtruction: but that he hath hated him whome he hath Predeſtinate to deſtruction: and that truely the cauſe of this hatered and deſtruction is manifeſt to vs, that is, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary corruption in Adam, whiche iſluyng vpon all his poſteritie, yéeldeth alſo like fruictes to the tree: and that to ſatiſfie all ſtayed wits, that albeit they know not the cauſe of the ſacred decrée, yet both bycauſe it is diuine, and alſo bycauſe deſtruction is ſo deſcerned, that togither the iuſte cauſes of perdition be determined abidyng in men them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, &amp; alſo they confeſſe it to be iuſte. Wherfore alſo we haue proued that, that we vſe not to ſpeake ſo, as that we ſay that any one is ſimply created of God to deſtruction, but therfore, that by his due damnation God might ſhew forth his iuſtice. But that the da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nation of the Reprobate is iuſte, bicauſe their perdition doth ſo depende vpon the Predeſtination of God, that yet the whole cauſe &amp; matter of their deſtruction be found in themſelues.

For that I ſay againe, before the Lorde would create men (we ſpeake of the order of cauſes) he neyther hateth or loueth: but whome he createth he hath decreed from euerlaſting, eyther to loue in Chriſte, or to hate in Adam. Therefore to create to perdition is not of hatred, but of him who hath decréed to hate, to hate (I ſaye) for iuſt cauſe, whiche he ſo annexed to the decrée of hatred, that all the fault be in him whome he hateth. Further, if
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:13650:20"/>no man be therefore created that God in his due deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion might be glorified: then God eyther hath determined to ſaue all, or boroweth the cauſes of his counſell of the foreknowen will of men, and that ſo, that whom he knew would refuſe grace offered, for that cauſe he ſhould vowe them to deſtruction, and in déede ſhoulde ſuffer them to runne headlong, ſéeing they will ſo. But oh good Lorde, howe many things be héere affirmed, not alone fooliſhly, but alſo wickedly? For if God hath decréed to ſaue all, as in déede he determined if he loue all, howe is it that he doth not ſaue all? Is it bicauſe he can not? If that be ſo: he is not omnipotent. Or is it that he will not? Then the Lorde altereth his counſell: and when he ſayth he repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, we muſte not nowe vnderſtande that to be ſpoken of God, not by tranſlation and improperlie, but proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and in déede. But and if he require the cauſe of hys purpoſe of the men them ſelues, what workeman is he that dependeth of his worke? yea, what wiſe man euer thinketh to ſay, that God determining to make men, firſt conſidered of what forte they woulde be, that thence he might conſult, then to haue conſidered wherfore he would create them? Then what ſhall become of them to whom grace is neuer offered, of which ſorte we haue foreſhewed that there be many.</p>
                     <p>Wilte thou ſay that all theſe are ſaued, for as muche as they haue not that foreknowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cauſe of refuſing grace? Sée, for as muche as thou haſte once declined from the right pathe, into what abſurdities thou runneſt. But this is the right way, that God hath created all for hys owne glorie, euen the wicked for the day of euill. In this doctrine is no circumſtance of wordes, no abſurditie, if thou doſte determine that whiche is moſte true, that the will of God (albeit it ſometimes ſéeme otherwiſe to vs) yet alwayes is the ſoueraigne rule of iuſtice.

If you being euill (ſaith Chriſt,) can yet giue good giftes to your chidren, how much more God: What gathereſt thou of this? that God being good createth none to miſerie.

                     <p>The thirde is by our obſeruing the ſequele of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall cauſes, as ofte times the naturall and wiſe men, and ſuche as are ſkilfull in humane things, do foretell manye things. But this coniecture in many things is deceitful and vncertaine, bicauſe that God oftentymes ordereth the meane cauſes, according to his ſecreate will.</p>
                     <p>But the fourth is the moſte ſure meane, and wythoute al exception the moſt ſure, bicauſe it iudgeth (as they ſay) of the latter. I therefore ſay there are two things, which not only the worde of GOD, but alſo common reaſon doth ſhewe vs. One is, that God is neuer chaunged, and therefore that that thing commeth to paſſe by the eternal and immutable decrée of Gods counſell, that thinges are often altered. For God not onely decréeth thoſe thinges, whiche are of ſtayed nature, of which forte there be very fewe, but alſo thoſe thinges, that for the moſte parte are chaunged euery houre, but not without aſſigned rules of alteration by him.</p>
                     <p>For example ſake, the Lorde bleſſed the earthe which he made, whiche after Adams ſinne he curſed. But is God changed? no indéede: but in the beginning only for a time he bleſſed that, which being fulfilled, he had determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to curſe the ſame for the ſin of Man. If any aſke me whence I haue them, I wil anſwere, that I haue it from the ſucceſſe. For ſéeing God is not chaunged, and that it came ſo to paſſe as I ſaide, of neceſſitie it is we confeſſe, that it was ſo determined with God from the beginning. Alſo the Lorde gaue the ceremonies of the lawe to hys
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:13650:26"/>Churche by Moſes, who notwithſtanding by the Apoſtle pronounceth afterwardes, if you be circumciſed, Chriſte proſyteth you nothing. But dothe the Lorde chaunge his purpoſe, that he ſhoulde allowe that whiche before he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allowed? no indéede. For he ordained the ceremonies but for a time, that is, to the preaching of Chriſte, at whoſe comming it was requiſite, that they ſhould vaniſh away, as darkeneſſe in the day ſpring.</p>
                     <p>Alſo, he aſſigned Saule King ouer Iſraell, but for a time: whiche albeit he did not manifeſt at the beginning, yet he ſufficiently hathe proued it, when he receiued him. And togither when he decréed that he woulde reiect hym, he determined the cauſe iuſtely, and he would take from him his kingdome for his owne faulte, all which are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly collected by the ſucceſſe. And the other is this, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che common reaſon doth ſhewe vs, that nothing is done which God knoweth not, or againſt his will, or he being idle: for neither ignoraunce, nor imbecilitie is agréeable with the nature of God, nor an idle foreknowledge may be attributed to him, ſpecially in the gouernment of ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent a worke, that is to ſaye, of Man, but that for the moſte part the wicked aſſertion of Epicures wil be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, That God careth not for men.

                     <p>Of theſe it is eaſily gathered, what is to be thoughte of the ende of the fyrſt made man, truely that (which the iſſue ſheweth) he was created good, but with this condici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that in certayne time, of his owne accorde, and by no faulte of the Creator, this goodneſſe béeing loſt, hée mighte ignorauntly prepare the way, both to them that are to be ſaued in mercy, by whoſe ſaluation, God hath decréede from euerlaſting to manifeſt his glory: and alſo to thoſe that ſhould iuſtly be damned, in whoſe iuſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, lykcwyſe he determined from euerlaſting, to ſhew forth the inmeaſurableneſſe of his iuſtice, and ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. Adam therefore was created good, ſo that if thou conſydereſt this ſtraight of nature by it ſelfe, that is the integritie and innocencie, then he might and ought to bée ſaued, and alſo his poſteritie that hee was to bring forth lyke to himſelfe. But if thou conſydereſt Gods decrée, that is, wherefore he created him good, thou ſhalt fynd hée neyther could remayne good, which appertayneth to the ſucceſſe, nor that his poſteritye could be borne in anye o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eſtate, then in that whereto as inthraled, God from euerlaſting had determined they ſhoulde be borne.</p>
                     <p>Thou demaundeſt whence I haue theſe? I aunſwere that I collect them of the ſucceſſe, or as they ſay of the latter, nor that thou canſte denye thoſe thinges I haue ſpoken, but that eyther thou ſhouldeſt make God vary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and inconſtant, or weake and ignoraunt, or that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertayneth to the ordinance of cauſes, vnoccupyed, I adde alſo raſh and vnſkilfull. For what? before he made man, did he not forſée with himſelfe wherefore he would make him? or at the leaſt foreſéeing the faultes, defermyne
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:13650:29"/>what he woulde do vnto men.</p>
                     <p>Who I pray thée could indifferently ſuffer theſe thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to be ſpoken of God, whiche are not to be founde in men, except ſuche as are deſtitute of all witte and reaſon? But if he hadde with himſelfe foreſette anend, I aſke of thée what it was? Thou wilte ſaye to bleſſe al men. Now therefore good fellowe ſhewe howe the counſells of God are not vncertaine, and infirme. Howe God is not varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and inconſtante, howe not altogither weake, if by no meanes he now performe that which he had determined, concerning the bleſſed life of all men. For neither cauſte thou ſaye by that thine inuention, that euen thoſe whome he ſaueth, are not ſaued by thy forged decrée, ſéeing they are ſaued by Grace, not by nature. And there is no doubt, that very manye are giuen ouer to eternall forments, ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without Chriſt there is no ſaluation, and Faith com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of hearing. But by his owne faulte thou wilte ſay. I graunte it, but what doth that helpe thée? For if that were decréede with God, to ſaue Adam, and all his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, ſurely either God will not, or he can not performe that he had decréede: if he will not, then he hathe changed his purpoſe, if he cannot, then is he not omnipofent. But how farre off both be from the nature of God, thou ſéeſt. Therefore, alſo that kinde of Doctrine, by thine argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whiche enforceth vs to theſe blaſphemies is falſe. Yet further I geſſe thou haſte one refuge in ſtore, that is, that thou maiſte ſay that God indéed created Adam, and all men comprehended in him to eternall life, but vppon condition, if Adam ſhould perſiſt in hys innocencie, which was ſet in his power, and therefore that God ſéemeth not to haue chaunged his purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>I aun ſwere, that it is true that thou ſaiſfe of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, but not in that whiche thou ſuppoſeſt.

Yea the Prophet, whoſe double teſtimonie thou a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſeſt, diſputeth againſt the men of thy faction, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained that by the abſolute power of God (as they cal it) they had incurred Gods vengeance, as though God ſhuld deale with them tyrannouſly, that is, ſhould rage againſt them, whether by right or wrong. But what ſayeth the

And the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of reprobates is alſo of this kinde, not that God is ſimply delited therewith, but for his owne glory, for which cauſe he teſtifieth by Salomon that he created the wicked agaynſt the day of euill. Therefore I haue often ſaide, that we vſe not to ſpeake ſo, as to ſay that God crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted any men for their deſtructions ſake, but that by the iuſte deſtruction of ſome he might manifeſt his owne glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, verily then the which end, nothing more iuſt or requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite can be imagined. Therefore this appertayneth nothing to the purpoſe of the preſent co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſie, whether God for his owne glory haue predeſtinate ſome, that is, the wicked to deſtruction: which thou denieſt: I with Moſes &amp; Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon affirme: neither canſt thou gather any thing elſe out of thoſe places of Ezechiel, then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which we ſay, that God is ſo louing, that when he dealeth with men after their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerte, he is not delighted with their deſtruction, but alone prouideth for the glory of his owne name: like as iuſt and fauourable iudges regard not the torment of offenders, as though y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> only were their purpoſe to ſhed mens bloud, but bicauſe the law &amp; equitie requireth, that by the puniſhment of offenders the wicked may be feared, &amp; the good may be defended from the iniuries of euil men, therfore they haue hated not the men, but offences in the men, and by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript of lawes do puniſh them.

Peter in that place whiche thou wreſteſt after thy maner, ſtrengthning the elect agaynſt certaine ſcoffers, who, (as to many at this day) did deride whatſoeuer was ſpoken of the ſupreme iudgement. Beloued, ſaith he, be not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in this one poynt, that a thouſande yeares with the Lorde are as one day, and one day as a thouſande yeares: that is, as I take it, that the Lord after the maner of men is not bounde to any moments of time, which is to ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerued of ſome. Then he addeth, the Lorde that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed is not ſlacke, as many accompt this ſlackneſſe, but he is lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g ſuffering to vs warde notwilling that any ſhould

For firſt let vs weigh who he is that hath promiſed to come, that he might vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deliuer his. In very déede he is God. But may he then deferre his promiſe euen one moment, whoſe worde is moſte ſure, and who hath prefixed appointed ſeaſons to his promiſe? Then ſée how ſome by impatience do ſini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterly eſtéeme this ſufferance. For they thinke that the Lorde dothe after a ſorte diſpiſe his Churche, or that he dothe not eſtéeme it ſo muche as is requiſite, when of the contrarie parte, the Lorde woulde not deferre that his comming, except he ſhoulde vſe great patience and lenitie towardes vs. For he onely deferreth his comming till he ſhal haue gathered his people, whereof he will not that one ſhoulde periſhe, but rather that by true repentance they ſhoulde all be ſaued. It is proued by many reaſons, that this is the ſimple, plaine, and apparant meanyng of the wordes of Peter. To this ende he indeuoreth, that he may confirme the faithfull againſt Epicures: whence it is that he alleageth thoſe things whiche ſolely belong to the faythfull, that in déede he mighte recall them to the promiſes. Finally, Peter is wholly conuerſant in this, that he may teache the delay of the iudgement to come to indure more patiently, whiche in déede do not agrée with the frowarde and obſtinate, who woulde pray the Lorde to protracte that iudgement as long as mighte be, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by this ſpeache of the Diuels, why dyddeſt thou come to torment vs before the time: ſo farre is it of that the Lordes tariance ſhoulde ſéeme too long to them.

But we will alſo adde theſe of abundance, that your impudencie may more and more appeare. There be (ſayeth he) thrée things to be noted. Firſte, the eternall predeſtination of God, to be firme and ratified, wherby he determined, what ſhould come to paſſe of all mankinde, &amp; of euery man before Adam fell. Then that Adam hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe for the worthineſſe of his defection, is inthralled to death: and finally in his perſon being nowe deſperate and a caſtaway, that all his progeny was ſo damned, that whome afterwards God did fréely elect, he ſhoulde digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie with the honor of Adoption. But alſo a little after in the ſame place, when (ſaith he) there is anye ſpéeche had of Predeſtination. I haue euer conſtantly taught, and thys day do teach, that there they muſt beginne, that all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate whiche are caſt away and damned in Adam, are worthelie lefte in deathe, that they periſhe worthely, who are by nature the children of wrath, ſo that no man haue cauſe to complayne of Gods too muche ſeueritie, ſéeyng that all menne carrie the guiltineſſe ſhutte vp in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. If we returne to the firſt man when he was cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated innocente, that he fell willingly, and thereby that it came to paſſe, that by his owne faulte, he broughte vppon hym and his deſtruction. Nowe albeit that Adam fell no otherwayes than God knowying, and ſo ordey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, hée loſt both hymſelfe and hys poſteritie, yet that maketh nothyng eyther to the deminiſhing of hys faulte, or charging of God wyth the cryme, for thys is euer to bée conſydered, that hée depriued hym ſelfe of that innocencie whyche he receyued of GOD, hée voluntaryly vowed hymſelfe into the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:13650:38"/>bondage of ſinne and Satan: willingly gaue himſelf head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to deſtruction. One excuſe is pretended, that he could not auoyde that which was decreed of God. But volum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary tranſgreſſion ſuffiſeth inough, and too much, to guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: For the ſecrete counſell of God is not the proper and naturall cauſe of ſinne, but the manifeſt will of man. The fooliſh complaint of Medea is of the olde Poet wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily derided, <hi>Vtinam ne in nemore pelio &amp;c.</hi> She beyng ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <note place="margin">☜</note> with the ſurious loue of a ſtraunger and vnknowen man, betrayed hir countrey, when ſhe was in hir ſelf guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of infidelitie, and barbarous crueltie, when the ſcourge of inchaſtitie doth afllict hir: ſhe fooliſhly turneth hir ſelfe to cauſes a farre off, when man findeth within himſelf the cauſe of euill, what auayleth it to wander that he may ſéeke it in heauen? The faulte is manifeſt, in that, that he would ſinne: why doth he (ruſhing into the paſſages of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen) drowne himſelfe in a Labarinth? Albeit that menne wandering by infinite fetches do indeuour to deceaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, they ſhall neuer ſo amaſe themſelues, but they ſhall receyue the ſenſe of ſinne grauen in their hartes: vngodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe therefore laboureth in vaine to deliuer man, whome his owne conſcience condemneth. And for that God wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly, and willingly did ſuffer man to fall, the cauſe may be ſecrete, but vniuſte it cannot be. This is Caluines ſentence of Adams fall, whiche why it ſhould diſpleaſe thée thou ſhouldeſt rather haue ſhewed, then to haue ſo impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſlaundred it: but there be twoo things whiche you vſe to pretende, to the whiche, I will anſwere apart. Firſt yée complaine, as you are men very religious, that by this meanes God becommeth the author of all ſinnes, ſith by the fall of Adam all haue ſuccéeded, whoſe offence is to be attributed vnto him, if in déede Adam fell by his ineuitable decrée. Then you requyre the expreſſe worde of GOD, whereby that doctrine may be ratified. That which belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:13650:39"/>to the firſte, thou haſt heard already, wherefore thys thy conſequence is naughte worth, God ordeyned thys, therefore he is in the fault. Caluine ſheweth a reaſon out of Auguſtine in theſe words. This (ſayth he) without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie is to be holden, that God hath euer hated ſinne, for indéede this prayſe whereby he is glorifyed of Dauid, is incident to him, that he is a God that will no iniquitie, but rather in ordeyning the fall of man, he had a moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and iuſt end, from which the very name of ſinne is eſtraunged. Although I ſo affirme him to haue ordeyned it, as I graunt not that he was the proper author thereof, doeſt thou héere (Sycophant) Caluine excellently refuting that very blotte of blaſphemy, whiche falſely and malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly you obiect againſt him? but yet theſe things ſatiſfye thée not. Be it ſo, for what may ſatiſfye ſuch enuie, ſuche madneſſe, and ſuch leawdeneſſe, as this is? But yet indéede theſe things do (whether thou wilt or no) ſufficiently ſhew what wickedneſſe it is, to dare obiect y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> to any man, whych he hath playnely teſtifyed, that he hateth as a moſt wicked blaſphemie.

Confeſſe therefore by thys place of the Apoſtle, that it is God whiche hathe made the vaſſals of wrath and mercy, and therefore hathe iuſtly ordeyned the neceſſarie cauſes to that ende, excepte thou hadſt rather accuſe God of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and raſhneſſe, or ymagine the Potter to depende vpon the clay, and not the contrarie, that the Potter for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the Clay, ſo as it pleaſeth him, that it may come to the appoynted end. Furthermore when Paule ſayth, that God hath included all vnder diſobediente,<note place="margin">Rom. 11.32.

But theſe in déede ſéeme not to the ſufficiently manifeſt, for thou wouldeſt that a place ſhould be ſet downe, wherein God ſhould be ſayd manifeſtly, and in playne words, to haue willed and decréed, that Adam ſhoulde fall, but I aſke

But ſith thou canſt not denye theſe, how is it that when we come to that hiſtorie of Adam, wherein is deſcribed his fall, thou wilt not follow this order, but requireſt the expreſſe ſentence of God. For, thou wilte ſaye, bycauſe it is farre from the nature of God, to conſtitute that whiche is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil, ſo much the more that ſelfe thing whiche is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne of all euill. But we haue already ſhewed before, that God dothe ordeyne iuſtly thoſe things whiche men do vniuſtly, that God (I ſay) dothe well vſe a ſinning in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, for God conſidereth one thing, that is, his owne glory, for which he hath made euen the wicked, as Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſayth, but the froward will of Sathan, and wicked men promiſeth it ſelfe another thing. So it commeth to paſſe, that in one ſelfe worke God is iuſt, Sathan wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and men vnrighteous. That thou mayeſt vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande thys, ſette we before vs thys ſelfe example of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam. When God woulde make man for the manifeſting of the glory both of hys mercie and iuſtice, as the iſſue of the matter ſheweth, and the Apoſtle ſetteth before vs, vnder the example of the Potter. He made Adam to hys owne ſimilitude, that is, holy and innocente, as the ſame Apoſtle expoundeth. But why did he that? truly bycauſe, that ſith he is good, nothing can be created of him that is wicked. But it is requiſite that they be depraued, both of whome he hath determined to ſhewe mercy, and alſo, whome for hys glories ſake he hath decréed iuſtly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne, then bycauſe albeit he coulde haue created that whyche was defyled, yet if he hadde created any defyled thyng, he coulde not iuſtly condemne hys owne worke. Therefore (I ſaye) it was néedefull that Adam ſhoulde be created holy and innocente, that he whyche of hys owne frée wyll, wythout anye faulte of God, became de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyled, ſhoulde open the way to Gods eternall counſels,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:13650:43"/>that is, to the manifeſting both of hys mercy and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. It was therefore requiſite that God ſhoulde open thys onely way to hymſelfe, that is, ordeyne the fall of Adam, but to that ende whyche I ſayde, whyche ſéeing it is moſt iuſt and holie, it followeth, that his ordinance is alſo iuſt. But Sathan in the meane whyle vnwitting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſeruing the determination of God, what doth he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauoure? truely béeyng inflamed wyth the hatred of God, and boyling wyth enuie, he laboureth ſo deface that excellente worke of God, But what dothe Adam, and Eue? truely they doe violently thruſt downe euen God hymſelfe as a lyer and enuious, from the throne of hys deytie. The Serpente therefore, and Adam and Eue are worthely puniſhed, who were ſo the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of God, that ſo muche as in them lay, they were not obediente to hym, but rather conſpired agaynſte hym, yet manifeſted the way to hys eternall and iuſt councell. The beginnyng of ſinne is to be ſoughte in the voluntarie mouing of the inſtrumentes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it commeth to paſſe, that God hathe iuſtly decréede that whiche they vniuſtly dyd, as wée before alleadged out of Auguſtine.

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:13650:44"/>why doeſt thou not rather enquire who thy ſelfe arte, and reuerence the goodneſſe of God in falne and corrupted A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam?

But goe to, at the laſt let vs ſtrike ſayle. I haue ſhewed what rule we muſt follow in weying examples. I alſo haue ſhewed, that héere is no blaſphemy whiche thou mayeſt feare. It remayneth that I ſhewe out of what Chapters of Chriſtian doctrine it may euidently appeare to be true that we affirme, that is, that Adam fell neyther by chance, or God not knowing of it, or ydlely ſuffering it to be ſo, and much leſſe againſt his will. This therefore (I ſay) is confirmed by al thoſe places of Scripture, where is affirmed, that there is no raſhneſſe with God that is omnipotent: that God hathe not only made all things, but alſo dothe gouerne them: that God careth, and hath euer cared for men: that there is nothing ſecrete to God: that God is not changed, nor moued with repentance, albeit the Scripture doth ſometimes ſpeake ſo, that it may as it were maffle with vs, all theſe (I ſay) thou muſt eyther re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute as falſe, or confeſſe that whiche we affirme, and I haue repeated already a thouſande times, that is, that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam hath falne, God not only foreknowing, but alſo iuſtly ordeyning and decréeing it, for if before the workeman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he did deliberate wherfore he would make ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he did raſhly and vnaduiſedly. If he decréed another thing then that which came to paſſe, he is eyther not almighty, whoſe councels Satha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath infringed, or inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtant, which changeth hys purpoſe. Beholde Sycophant, more mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt teſtimonies of Scripture as I thinke, than thou wouldeſt, and many moe than thou lookeſt for, but that is
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:13650:44"/>almoſt incredible, that thou, who ſo carefully be thynkeſt howe thou mayeſt ſupport the iuſtice of God, that is to ſay, ſtaggering, and in daunger to fall, didſt neuer conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der howe weake that is whereto thou leaneſt, albeit we ſhould graunt it thée. For I pray thée (if thou pleaſeſt to examine this deuine wiſedome by the rule of mans iudgemente) how ſhall God be without fault, if man ſo left by his determination, and proſtitute to the fraude of Sathan, that the workemaiſter did idlely from Heauen ſée him fall, who yet coulde haue vpholden him with hys only becke when he was falling, nor had any cauſe why he ſhould hate him?

When that Swyne Quintinus once as it was came into a place, where one did lye ſlayne, and a certayne godly man was there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, who ſaid for very horror, wo is me, who hathe done this wicked acte? he aunſwered by and by in hys Picar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian tong, I, if thou wilt know, haue done it. Then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as one aſtoniſhed, ſaid, haſt thou, art thou ſo wicked? Quintinus aunſwereth, I am not he, but it is God. How ſayth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other, are y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> offences to be imputed to God which he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeth to be puniſhed?

For that which I and thou do, God doth, alſo what God doth we do, for he is in vs. This being granted, this ſinne ſhould be imputed to God: or it is to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded, that there is no ſinne done in the world, ſith there is nothing which is not made of God, ſo all dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of good and euill is taken away, whereon it wyll followe that we may not reprooue any thing as euill, ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all be the workes of God, and it ſhall be lawfull for men, as it were with reynes let looſe, to doe whatſoeuer commeth in their mind, not only bycauſe we are without the da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger of ſinning, but alſo bycauſe to reſtreyne any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, is to hinder God. For example, hath one committed whoredome? he is not to be blamed, for there ſhoulde be inforced blaſphemie againſt God. Hath ſome one deſired his neyghbours wife? let him haue hir if he can, for hée knoweth certaynely that he doth nothing but the will of God. That apperteyneth to riches, he that can get them
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:13650:47"/>by force, or by anye craftie meanes, let him do it boldly, for he ſhall vndertake nothing whiche is not alowed of God.

                              <p>There was at Paris a certayne Cobler ſo forced with the poyſon of thys ſecte, that hée iudged nothyng to bée euill.</p>

                              <p>WEdenie not, but all things are done by the will of God, and ſo muche the more, when we declare why he is called Almightie,<note place="margin">Geneſis. 4.</note> we attribute vnto him an effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all power in all creatures, and teach, that hauing once created the vniuerſall world, he alſo doth ſo gouerne the ſame, and hath euer his hand ready in the worke, that he may kéepe all things in their eſtate, and diſpoſe them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his wil. That I may more eaſily expreſſe what this meaneth, I ſay, that we muſt conſider that God doth worke thrée manner of wayes in the vniuerſall goerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For firſt, there is an vniuerſall working, whereby he directeth all creatures according to the ſtate and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie whiche he hathe giuen to euery of them, when hée created them. This gouernance is nothing elſe than that
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:13650:48"/>which we call the order of nature. For whileſt the infidels due acknowledge nothing in the diſpoſition of the worlde, but that they ſée with their eyes, and therefore conſtitute nature as it were a Goddeſſe whiche ſhould rule and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne all things: this glory is to be giuen to the will of God, that it alone guydeth and ruleth all things. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when wée ſee the Sunne, the Moone, and Starres per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme their courſe, let vs thinke that they obey God, that they execute his commaundements: and not that onely, but that they are gouerned with Gods hande, and that all things are done by his power. So when we beholde the courſe of earthly things, al things to be attributed to God, but the creatures are to be iudged as inſtruments in hys band, which he will apply to the worke, howſoeuer it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him. The Scripture oftentimes toucheth this vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall prouidence, that we may learne to giue glory to God in all his workes. And God eſpecially commendeth to vs this his power, that we may acknowledge the ſame in our ſelues, to the ende we may be ridde fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> arrogancie, which, ſo ſoone as we forget that we be in his hande, dothe vſe by and by to ſurmount in vs. To this it is that Paule ſayde at Athens. In him we liue, moue, and haue our beyng:<note place="margin">Act. 17.</note> for he doth teſtifie vnto them, that excepte he do ſuſtayne vs with his hande, for neuer ſo litle moment of time we can not continew, ſeing we remayne in him: and as the ſoule diſperſeth his power thorowe all the bodie, dothe inforce the members: that ſo we be quickened of God, of whome we obtayne, whatſoeuer ſtrength and abilitie is in vs. Yet this vniuerſall working of God, dothe not let but that all creatures bothe in heauen and earth, may receyue their qualitie and nature, and folowe their proper inclination. The other way whereby God worketh in his creatures, is that he compelleth them to the obedience of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, iuſtice, and iudgement: euen as be will nowe helpe
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:13650:49"/>his ſeruaunts, nowe puniſhe the guiltie, nowe trie the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of the faythfull, or chaſten them with a father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affection. So when he will beſtowe aboundance of fruytes, he giueth Raynes in his time, ſendeth warmth by his Sunne, and lightſome and ſayre dayes: then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo he vſeth other naturall meanes as inſtruments of hys louyng kindneſſe. But when he dothe withdrawe his hande unto himſelfe, the heauen becommeth as it were braſſie, the earth as ironie. Therefore it is he that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth Thunders, Froſte, Hayles, and Tempeſtes, and he cauſeth barra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>neſſe. Therfore whatſoeuer the Ethniques &amp; ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t attribute to fortune, we muſt aſcribe to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diuine prouidence: not ſo much to that vniuerſall power, wherof we haue ſpoken, but to his ſpeciall moderation wherby he gouerneth al things,<note place="margin">Eſa. 45.</note> as ſeemeth beſt and moſt to his glory. And that he teacheth, when he ſayeth by the prophets, that he createth light and darkeneſſe, ſendeth lyſe &amp; death: that nothing good or euil co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth but from his hand: in ſo much that he ſaith that he gouerneth alſo lots, and other things which ſéeme caſual.<note place="margin">Prou. 16.</note> But if ſome one be caſually ſlaine not by fore practice, that he is cauſe of hys death, and hath ſo appoynted, leaſt we ſhoulde denie any to fall by chaunce, but all things by the determination of his counſell. And he is vehemently offended, when we thinke that any thyng ro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth from other where, and do not looke upon him, that we may acknowledge him, not onely as the principall cauſe of all, but alſo as the Author, determinyng by this or that meane all things by his counſell. So therefore let us conclude, that as wel proſperitie as aduerſitie, Raynes, Windes, Hayles, Froſte, Brightneſſe, Aboundance, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, Warre, and Peace are the workes of God, and that the creatures, whiche be inferiour cauſes, be onely inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments whiche he hath in uſe to execute hys will: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vieth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at hys pleaſure, turneth thoſe thyngs which
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:13650:49"/>way ſoeuer it pleaſeth him, &amp; bringeth them to that paſſe, that that vndoubtedly may be done whiche he hath deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined. There is further to be noted, that he vſeth not onely ſenceleſſe creatures in thys ſorte, that by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be may worke and performe his will, but euen men themſelues &amp; alſo the Diuel. In ſo much that euen Sathan and the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked are executers of the Diuine will. Euen as he vſed the Egyptians to afflict hys people: and a litle whyle after he ſtirred up the Aſſyrians, and others lyke, that he mighte puniſh theyr offences. We ſée he vſed the Diuell that he might torment Saule, deceyue Achab, and when néede is to exerciſe his iudgements againſt al the wicked, or on the otherſide to proue the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtancie of his owne people: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Iob is an example unto us. Whiche things when the Libertines here, raſhly and vnaduiſedly breakyng out, nor lookyng any further, they conclude, that the creatures doe nothyng elſe. So they horribly confounde all things. For they confound not onely heauen with earth, but God with the Diuell. And that commeth ſo to paſſe, bycauſe they obſerue not twoo exceptions muche neceſſarie. The firſt is, that Sathan and the wicked are not ſo Gods inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, but they alſo play there owne partes. For wée muſte not ſo immagine, that GOD worketh ſo by a wicked manne, as by a ſtone or blocke: but as by a reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable creature, accordyng to the qualitie of nature, which he hath gyuen hym. When therefore we ſay that God worketh by creatures, that booteth not why the wicked for there parte ſhoulde not worke too,<note place="margin">Eſay. 5.</note> whiche alſo the Scripture dothe manifeſtly ſhewe. For as it pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth that GOD will hyſſe, and as it were ſounde with a Trumpette, that hée maye brynge out the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delles to battell, that he will barden and inflame their hartes: ſo it ceaſſeth not to ſhewe theyr owne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, and of what will they are, and aſcribeth vnto them
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:13650:50"/>that worke, which by Gods decrée they execute. The other exception, wherof theſe vnhappie men haue no vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, is this. That there is great oddes betwirt the worke of God, and the worke of a wicked ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſich God vſeth him but inſteede of an inſtrument. The wicked is incited to his worke with his couetouſneſſe, or ambition, or enuie, or crueltie, and he regardeth no other end. Therefore of that roote, that is of the affection of minde and ende whiche he reſpecteth, the worke taketh his qualitie, and is worthely iudged cuill. But God hath altogither reſpect of contrary things: that is to witte, that he may exerciſe his iuſtice to befend the good, that he may vſe his grace and mercie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the faythfull, and correct thoſe that deſerue euill. Sée in what ſort we muſt diſcerne betwirt God and men, that hence we may beholde in the ſelfe worke his ſuffice, goodneſſe, and iudgement: thence the malice of the Diuell and Infidels: but let vs take an excellent and lightſome glaſſe, wherein we may beholde theſe: When worde was brought to Iob of ſo great loſſe of his goods, of the death of his children, and of ſo many <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>
                                 </gap>uils which vefell him: he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged that God did vid viſits him, ſaying: the Lorde hath giuen me all theſe things, and he hath taken them. And in déede ſo the truth was, but in the meane time, did be not know that the Diuell did cauſe this euill vpon? vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtoode he not that the Chaldées had briuen away hys heardes and cattle? did he commende thoſe robbers and théenes? or did he excuſe the Diuell, bicauſe that affliction came out from God? No I trowe. For he vnderſtood that there was great difference in theſe things. Therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning euill, he ſayde. Bleſſed be the name of the Lorde. In like ſo Dauid, when Srmei did perſecute him, he ſayde he receyued it fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God: &amp; he ſaw that that wicked wretch was a rodde, wherwith God did chaſten him: but prayſing God, he dothe not therefore afterwardes leſſe condemne
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:13650:50"/>Semel. But I muſte yet deale of this in an other place. Let this now be ſufficient to holde, that God worketh ſo by his creatures, and ſo vſeth them to ſerue his prouivece, that the inſtrument whereby he worketh, ceaſeth not to be euill: and bycauſe that he turneth the wickedneſſe of the Diuell, and vngodly men, into good, therfore they be not cléered or excuſed by that they ſinne not, and theyr workes wicked and to be damned, for all take their qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of the purpoſe and will of the Author. Who ſo there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore diſtinguiſh not theſe things, doe ouerturne all things as twine with their ſnoute, and doe diſturbe thoſe things with horrible confuſion whiche are ſette in an excellent order. Such be the Libertynes, which not onely conioyne in felowſhip, the Diuel with God, but alſo tranſforme him into God: denying by this pretence his workes to be commendable, bicauſe he doth nothing but that whiche is appoynted of God. But this Hereſie, (if we gyue credite to the auncient Doctours) tooke his beginnyng of <hi>Simon Magus:</hi> Wée of the contrarie parie muſte obſerue, that the creatures in earth, doe their workes in theyr degree, whiche as they ſhalbe done to that or this ende, ſo are they to be taken to be good or euill. In the meane time, God gouerneth and diſpoſeth all things, and directeth them to a perfect ende: he turneth euill into good, or at the leaſt, working after the goodneſſe of hys owne nature, he enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth ſome goodneſſe, out of that whiche is euill, he ſo vſeth the Diuell, that he dothe not mingle himſelfe with him, whereby he may haue any thing common with him, or be intangled as conioyned in the ſocietie of euill, or with his iuſtice take away the nature of euill. For as the Sunne ſendyng forth his beames into a dead carcaſſe, and ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dryng certayne corruption therein, draweth nothing cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt or impure to it ſelfe: nor cauſeth by the pureneſſe of it, whereby the carcaſſe is the leſſe corrupt and filthie: ſo
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:13650:51"/>God worketh by the wicked in ſuch ſorte, that the iuſtice whiche is in him, ſhall not iuſtifie them, nor be defyled with their naughtineſſe and corruption.</p>
                              <p>The thirde kind of deuine working ſtandeth in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerning of the faithfull, in whome he liueth and reigneth by his Spirit. For as muche as we are depraued with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall ſinne, we are very like to barren and drye earth, bringing for the no good frute at all, for corrupte is oure iudgemente, our will diſobedient to God, prone and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye unto euill, and finally all our nature is defiled, which ſéeing it is ſo, we can not only not inforce oure minds to good things, but that whiche more is, we are not apte to thinke one good thought, but (as Paule ſayth) if we are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing apte, it is of neceſſitie that that come from him. Therefore it is he that worketh in us to will and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, whyche lighteneth vs, that he may bring us to the knowledge of himſelfe, he draweth vs to him, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth newe heartes in us, mollifying oure hardneſſe. He hymſelfe it is whyche breatheth into vs an affection of praying, imparteth power and ſtrength, to reſiſt all the temptations of Sathan, and cauſeth vs to walke in hys preceptes. But by the way is to be noted, that wée haue choyce and wyll by nature, but bycauſe both of them are depraued wyth ſinne, the Lorde dothe reforme them, and of euill dothe make them good, therefore by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are apte to diſcerne, for that we will, for that we doe thys or that, it is a naturall gifte, but in that we can make choyſe of deſire, or doe no other thing but euill, that is by the corruption of ſinne.</p>
                              <p>In that wée deſyre to doe well, and be indued wyth power to performe it, that commeth by ſupernaturall grace, whereby we are regenerate te a better, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>déede diuine lyfe. Beholde therefore what God worketh

But theſe frantike fellowes, crying out with force, that God doth all things, doe make hym the author of euill, and then as though the nature of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill were changed, whileſt it is couered vnder thys vayle of the name of God, they affirme it to be good, wherein they doe more violente and wicked ſclaunder agaynſte God, than if they ſhoulde tranſferre hys po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and iuſtice ſome other where, for ſéeyng there is nothing more proper to God than hys goodneſſe, it muſt néedes bée that he be denyed of hymſclfe, and be changed into a Deuill, that he myghte worke wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, whyche thyng is attributed vnto hym of theſe. And in déede there God is an Idoll, whiche is more exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable to vs, than the Idols of the Gentiles.

                              <p>I willingly in déede yéelde vnto them that, that a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ought (as he ſaith) to take euery thyng to profite: but in that ſence that the Seripture teacheth, that is, that in aduerſitie hée may call to remembraunce that whiche Paule ſayth, that the faythfull are afflicted for this cauſe, that they maye be conformed to the Image of Chriſte, and ſo lette afflictions bée a helpe to them, to obtayne ſaluation and let that conſolation ſuſtayne them. If he ſée hys brother ſlide or goe aſtray, let it be to hym in ſtéede of a glaſſe, to the ende that knowyng the infirmitie of mans nature, he maye walke in the more feare. But if it be ſo that hymſelfe fall, lette hym thereby be admoniſhed
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:13650:54"/>of his owne imbecillitie, that he may diſtruſt his owne ſtrength, and be made more humble, and lay aſide all ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogancie, and lette it be to hym as a ſpurre, whereby he may be furthered to call vpon God with more feruente inuocations. Sée howe Chriſtians turne all things to their commoditte, not that they may delight themſelues in their ſinnes, or ſhutte their eyes, leaſt they may behold that whych is euill, but rather that being heauie and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull, bycauſe they may ſée that God is offended both of themſelues and others, they may be prepared to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, humilitie, and the feare of God, and that they maye be carefull that they maye take héede to themſelues in time to come. After this ſort Dauid gathered commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie by the fault that he had committed, not in any reſpect iuſtifying himſelfe, but when he heard his condemnation more and more, confirming hymſelfe in the goodneſſe of God, foreſéeing leaſt afterwards he myght ſlyde agayne into ſuch calamitie.

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:13650:55"/>the fourtéenth to the Romanes, where he reproueth them that condemne their bréethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for matters indifferent: we haue (ſayeth he) all one iudge, to him we muſt giue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comptes, it apperteyneth to him to determine of ſuche matters, let vs not therefore inforce oure neyghboures proſtrate vnder our opinion. In déede it is an excellente and moſt profitable doctrine to, as there is one ſpirituall lawgiuer that is God, ſo that he is the beſt Iudge of our minds. But in the meane time, the teſtimonie is not therefore of leſſe force, whiche already he hath broughte, when therefore we iudge whoredome, thefte, blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, dronkenneſſe, and ambition to be gréeuaus ſinnes, we giue no iudgemente of our ſelues, but we approoue that whiche God hath giuen. But of the contrary, theſe ſhameleſſe dogges, feygning that they will not iudge, doe make themſelues higher iudges than God. I pray thée, if after the ſupreme Iudge haue gyuen ſentence, ſome priuate man ſhould ſay, the matter is to be left in doubt, as if nothyng ſhoulde bée certayne, and the matter by iudgement condemned, not to be taken as euill, ſhoulde not hée as a factious man, or author of ſedition, be dée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med muche worthy of greate puniſhmente, bycauſe hée would ſubuert all order of right? But theſe filthy dogges, vnder this pretence, that they ſaye, we muſt not iudge, endeauour to make fruſtrate the ſupreme iudgementes of the higheſt God, whyche he hathe publiſhed to all the worlde, and that whatſoeuer he hath pronounced, is but deceyuing.</p>
                              <p>We ſée therefore, that as we maye not preſume ſo farre, as to iudge accordyng to the luſt of oure owne heart, ſo all things are to be approued, and as it were ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifyed with our aſſente whyche God hathe iudged, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as auouche hym to be a good and righteous Iudge, we ſhall condemne with him wicked workes, and as he
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:13650:55"/>aduiſeth, we ſhall iudge a good or cuill trée by his frutes. Afterwardes, they alleadge this ſentence, Hipocrite,<note place="margin">Math. 12.</note> firſte plucke the beame out of thine owne eye, and then ſhalte thou ſée to remoue the mote out of thy brothers eye. But what wyll they conclude thereof?<note place="margin">Math. 7.</note> Thys aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere belongeth to Hypocrytes, who onely note other mens faultes, and conceale their owne, as when hée ſayde to them whyche accuſed the Adultreſſe, hée that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt you is withoute ſinne, lette him caſt the firſte ſtone at hir.

But betwixte theſe two there is maruellons great difference, to iudge nothing by Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie, and vtterly to iudge nothyng. The Lorde com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth, that we iudge according to truth, that we be not more ſeueare agaynſte oure neyghboures, than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſte oure ſelues, but theſe dogges with this cullor will haue all iudgemente, be it neuer ſo conſonante to reaſon, to bée excluded and aboliſhed. Albeit if an Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erite flattering himſelfe, ſhall reprehende another, it followeth not, that hée whyche hathe offended, ſhall therefore bée excuſed, for euill is euer to bée damned.

But it is beſt to note Sathans ſubtiltie in this place, and whereto it tendeth, for ouer and aboue that oure neygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boures faultes, and the ſcourges, wherewith God puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth them, ought ſufficiently to warne vs, that we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke not his anger againſt ourſelues. There is alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother thing required of vs, that is, that oure mindes ought to be ſtricken with griefe, bycauſe God is offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, and bycauſe the ſoule of the finner runneth to deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. With ſuch a zeale of Gods glory we ſhoulde be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed, that when it is imperilled, we ſhould be oppreſſed with the anguiſh of ſorowes, where with oure heart may be ſore afflicted. We oughte ſo to loue our neyghboures with a ready affection of minde, that when we ſée the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill hang ouer them, and eſpecially their ſoules, we maye be moued with compaſſion. Sathan indéede by theſe Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels would make men amazed, that whatſoeuer confuſion we ſhall ſée, we ſhall be touched with no care, nor be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in any ſort.

And they alſo ſecretely mocke them of whome they are nouriſhed, and ldoe thruſt out their tongs behinde theyr backes. For al their delighte and ſtudye is in this, that they may iocandly take their pleaſure in quietneſſe and ſecuritie, for they haue heard this ſentence of Salomon, that the bones are withered with a ſorowfull ſpirite. So leaſt loſt with leaneneſſe, they haue founde this way of pleaſant and peaceable delighting, that is, al carefulneſſe
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:13650:56"/>expelled, in approouing all thoſe things, wherewith it is of neceſſitie, that Gods children be moued and troubled in mind, leaſt they ſhould haue any more cauſe of ſorrow.

But Iob himſelfe reknowledgeth the Lordes worke in it, who he ſayeth, tooke from him thoſe thinges that were taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by the Chaldes. Now may we referre the ſelfeſame worke to God, to Sathan, to man the author, but eyther we ſhall excuſe Sathan by Gods company, or pronounce God the author of euil? eaſily, if we firſte conſider the ende of working, and then the manner. The Lordes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination is to exerciſe the patience of his ſeruaunte by calamitie: Sathan laboureth to driue him to deſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: The Chaldees by another mans goodes, beſydes right and equitie, ſée to gette aduantage. Such diuerſitie
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:13650:57"/>in the purpoſes dothe mightely diſtinguiſhe the worke, there is no leſſe difference in the manner, God yéeldeth hys ſeruaunte to bée afdicted to Sathan, hée yéeldeth hym the Chaldees, whome he choſe to be hys miniſters to execute it, and gyueth them to be inforced, Sathan o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwayes prouoketh the wicked mindes of the Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees wyth their poyſoned dartes, to the accompliſhment of that wicked acte. They furiouſely ruſhe to imuſtice, and wrappe and defyle all their members with wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, Sathan therefore is properly ſayde to worke in the reprobate, in whome he exerciſeth his kingdome, that is, the kingdome of ſinne God is ſayde alſo to worke after this manner, bycauſe Sathan hymſelfe, ſéeyng hée is but an inſtrumente of hys wrath, he inforceth hym thys way and that way as he will, and at his becke, to execute hys iuſt iudgementes. I let paſſe héere the vniuerſall mouing of God, whence all creatures, as they are ſuſteyned, ſo they receyue efficacie to doe any thing.

Pighius vrgeth, that if mans Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacie be Gods worke, it is falſe that the Scripture ſayeth, that all thynges are good whyche God hathe made, but I can ſafely teſtifye, and boldly pronounce, that thys falſe imagination did neuer enter into my thought, I therefore affirme euery where, that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man was fyrſte made innocente, leaſt the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe

The ſame, in the ſame Booke, whatſoeuer menne ſinne, they would impute it to hym, but if any woulde eſcape, (I ſaye) hée is more ſtreyghtely cheyned wyth the bondes of conſcience, than that hée maye delyuer hymſelfe from iuſt damnation. Lette Adam make excuſe as he wyll, that he was deceyued by the enticementes of the wife whyche God gaue him, yet the deadly poyſon of infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie within, the ſecrete moſt peſtilent aduiſor ambition, the diueliſhe breathing of preſumption, will be founde within. They are therefore much leſſe to be excuſed, who endeauoure to drawe the cauſe of their euils, out of the déepe ſecretes of God, whiche bewrayeth it ſelfe out of their owne depraued hearte. Lette euery one acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his owne ſinne, condemne himſelfe, and confeſſing from his heart his owne giltineſſe, let him ſeriouſely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate his iudge If any murmure, the exception is ready, O Iſraell, thy deſtruction commeth of thy ſelfe. The ſame in the ſelfeſame Booke, ſpeaking to the ſclanderer. They charge vs (ſaith he) with a filthy and ſhamefull ſlaunder, who pretend that God is the author of ſinne, if his wil be the cauſe of all things that are done, for that whiche man wickedly committeth, ſet on eyther by ambition, or by co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetouſeneſſe, or by luſt, or by whatſoeuer other wicked af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, ſeing God worketh by his hand according to his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, although ſecret iudgemente, the name of ſinne can haue no place in him, infidelitie, crueltie, pride, intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, enuie, blinde ſelfeloue, anye wicked affection, cauſeth ſinne in man. In G O D thou ſhalte finde no ſuche thing. And a little after, ſuche is (ſayeth hée)

But what? do not theſe ſuffice thée in the manifeſting of Caluines minde, and prouing thy falſies: Lette vs therefore adde thoſe things whiche hée wrote vppon that place, where Peter vpbraydeth the Iewes, that by the haude of wicked men they crucifyed Ieſus,<note place="margin">Actes. <hi>2.</hi>

I anſwere, that men, after a ſorte, to execute the ſame thing which God with himſelf hath determined, and yet do nothing leſſe than obey God, for obedience ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth of a voluntarie affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and we knowe that the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked haue a farre other intent. Again, no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> obeyeth God, but he that knoweth his will, obedience therfore depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth of the knowledge of the diuine will. Further in his lawe, God hath manifeſted his will to vs, wherefore, they fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally obey God, who meaſure their workes by the rule of his law, and then willingly ſubmit themſelues to hys go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernemente. We ſée no ſuche thing in all the wicked, whome ſkilneſſe, God inforceth hither or thither. Nowe therefore by this pretence will ſay they be excuſable, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they giue place to God, ſéeing we are to ſéeke the will of God in his lawe, and they as much as in them is, indeuour to rebell againſt God. As much as apperteineth to the other, I denie that God is the author of euill, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in this ſpéech there is a certain teſtimonie of a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked affect, for an euill acte is eſtéemed of the end whereto euery one te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit either theft or murder, they therefore ſinne, bycauſe they are théeues or murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers. In their theft of murther their wicked purpoſe is to
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:13650:58"/>be weyed. God who vſeth their iniquitie, is to be placed in an higher degrée. For he inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth a farre other matter, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he wil correct one, and exerciſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of an other: and ſo he neuer declineth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his nature, that is fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> perfect equitie. So in ſo much as Chriſt was deliuered by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of wicked men, and in that he was crucified, it is done by the appoyntment and ordinance of God. But the betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which of it ſelf is wicked, and the murther which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyneth in it ſuch haynous offence, ought not to be déemed as Gods worke. What wilt thou more? the day truely ſufficeth me not to recite ſuch teſtimonies. But if I ſhold haue alleaged but euen one of theſe teſtimonies, I thinke there is none, to whome your great and incredible impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie might not ſufficiently appeare. But yet I will ſet downe others in their place, and leaſt you complayne that I rather obſcure a darke matter then make it manifeſt, I will briefly ſhewe what our iudgement is of Gods ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce and action euen in thoſe things, which not as they are of God, but in reſpecte of theyr beyng done of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, deſerue the name of ſinne: and alſo what wée teach out of the worde of God, of the difference of ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and will: and then I will anſwere thine arguments a parte.

                              <p n="1">1 God effectually doth,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 1. 88.</note> or bringeth to paſſe all thyngs accordyng to the determination of his will.</p>
                              <p n="2">2 God verily executeth this counſell in certaine mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of time, but yet the ſame is eternall, and going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all things, not onely in time, ſeing it is before al time, but alſo in order. For otherwayes the will of God ſhould not be the chief rule of the counſell of God: but rather the foreſéene, or foreknowne qualitiess of things, inforcing God to take this or that counſell, ſhoulde preſcrive an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

                              <p n="4">4. This counſell is not onely ſet in the moderation and direction of effects, as Pallas with the Poet is ſayned to turne away the darte of Pandarus from the breaſt of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelaus, to the inferiour partes fenced with a ſtudded ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: but hath a workyng and effectuall force in al things, which Paule hath declared by the worde <gap reason="foreign">

                              <p n="5">5. This force and power of working is attributed to God working, for it is not ſayde to be of God. Therefore by this worde, there is not ſhewed any naturall facultie, giuen to certaine things of God the creator, to do this or that: but the very power of God which he hath in himſelf to do all things.</p>
                              <p n="6">6. The vniuerſall note in the ſaying of Paule, cannot be reſtrayned with any exception be it neuer ſo litle, but God in that parte ſhall be taken to be idle, by the aſſertion of Epicurus.

                              <p n="7">7 The concluſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therfore ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth, that God as it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him decreeth from euerlaſting all things to be, and ſo alſo performeth the ſame in his time by his owne power of workyng, cuen as he will.</p>

But all ſuche blaſpemies be moſte farre, not onely from our tongues, but from our thoughts. That theſe conſequences <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              <p n="20">20 For if theſe inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts be good, and reſpect the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted will of God, they do well, and God doth well by

                              <p n="22">22 And ſo God worketh by thoſe inſtruments, as he doth not only ſuffer them to worke, nor only moderateth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> effect but alſo he exciteth, inforceth, moueth, ruleth, &amp; fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore (which of al is the greateſt) euen createth them, that by them he may accompliſh that he hath determined, all which God doth iuſtly, and without all iniuſtice.</p>
                              <p n="23">23 For as oft as an euill man ſinneth eyther agaynſt himſelfe or ſome other lyke euill.

                              <p n="24">24 But ſo oft as the wicked annoy the good they in déede ſinne, &amp; at the laſt are worthily puniſhed, yet neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe the Lorde by them, correcteth, teacheth, and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth his, and in déede by the very enimies of the Churche he maketh his Church glorious.</p>

For albeit it is good whiche God worketh by the wicked, yet

                              <p n="26">26 Nor auayleth the conſequence, God doth al things, therefore he committeth ſinnes. For the name of ſinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth not, but with a depraued qualitie, whiche wholy is in the doyng inſtrument.</p>

                              <p n="28">28 Yet God worketh other waies by good inſtruments than by euill.

What is it (ſaith Auguſtine to Iulian) that thou ſayſte, when they are ſayde to be giuen ouer to their owne luſtes, they are to be taken leaft by the Diuine patience, and not inforced to ſinnes by power? As if the ſame Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle hath not ſet downe theſe two at once, bothe Patience and Power, where he ſayth, what and if God woulde,<note place="margin">Rom. 9.22.</note> to ſhewe his wrath, and make his power knowne, ſuffer with long patience the veſſels of his wrath, prepared to deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction?

And there ſtoode forth a ſpirite in the ſighte of the Lorde, and ſaide, I will deceiue him. And the Lorde ſaid to him: In what? And he ſaid, I wil go forth &amp; be a lying ſpirite in the mouth of all his Prophetes. And he ſaide, thou ſhalte ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce him, and ſhalte preuaile, goe oute, and doe ſo. What wilt thou ſay to theſe? Verily, the kyng himſelfe ſinned in beléeuing falſe Prophets. Ouer and aboue theſe, it was the puniſhment of ſinne. God being Iudge, and God ſending an euil ſpirite, that we might the more apparantly vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande howe it is ſaide in the Pſalme,<note place="margin">Pſal. 78.49.</note> that the Lord ſente the wrath of his indignation by euill Angels. But in er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring any whitte, in iudging or doing any thing raſhely or vniuſtly: God forbid. But it is not ſaide to him in vaine: Thy iudgements are as many déepes.

What is alſo that whiche we ſay dailye, Leade vs not into tĕptation, excepte, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we be not giuen ouer to oure luſtes? For euerye one is tempted, drawne, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed of his owne concupiſcence. May it be, that we aſke of GOD, that his goodneſſe be not patient towardes

God therfore giueth euer into the ſuffera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of reproch, that thoſe things may be done, which are not conuenient: but hée iuſtlye gyueth ouer, and thoſe thinges become ſinne, and the puniſhementes of ſinne paſte, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertes of puniſhementes to come. As he gaue Achab in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the lye of the falſe Prophets, as he gaue ouer Roboam to falſe counſell. He doeth theſe thinges by maruellous and vnſpeakeable meanes, whiche knoweth how to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute his iuſte indgements, not only in mens bodies, but in their heartes, whiche maketh not euill purpoſes, but vſeth them as he pleaſeth, ſéeing he cannot will anye thing vniuſtlye. Theſe ſaith Auguſtine agaynſie youre ercoure. But goeto, lette vs ſtrike ſaile at the laſte. By theſe therefore whiche wée haue made plaine in ſo many wordes, and confirmed by ſo many teſtimonies of Scriptures, we ſay, it ſufficientlye appeareth, that the name of Wil doth euen appertaine to thoſe things which although either of their owne nature, or for the euill pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of inſtruments are euill, yet in a certaine reſpect are good, that is, for aſmuche as God by them doth trie oute or correct the good, and puniſhe the euill. Therfore God is not contrarie to himſelfe ſo ofte as he wil, and wil not one &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſelfe ſame work, ſéeing it may he done in a diuers reſpecte, nor willeth he reſiſtances, ſo oft as he ſéemeth to will contraries, becauſe it may he, that thoſe which of their owne nature are repugnant in themſelues, may yet in ſome reſpect agrée betwene themſelues: And I will ſhew thée that, in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſame ſuppoſition, which thy ſelfe haſte propounded vs. That Caluin is a faithful &amp; true Prophet of God, it appereth by al thoſe argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, wherby y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thines of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can be approued to me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Therfore God wil, &amp;
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:13650:70"/>acceptable to him, that Caluine be taken for ſuch as he is, that is, for a moſt excellent inſtrument of the Church, and thoſe that do ſlaunder any man, there is no doubt but they do an iniurious worke againſt God. For he hath ſayde, he that receyueth you receyueth me, &amp; he that deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth me. Bycauſe alſo Chriſte is ſet for a downefall to many, who therefore loue darkeneſſe more than lighte, and therefore as worthie that they ſhould periſh, therefore God beyng angrie with the worlde, hath rayſed vp thée a falſe Prophete, and other thy likes cuerywhere, to whome he hath giuen the ſtrength of errour, that thoſe who haue refuſed the truth, might thorough you beléeue lies. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as he once commaunded Semei, ſo now you dogges, that you ceaſe not to barke at and bite a man, who of all that liue this day hath beſt deſerued of the Church of God. Yet neither do you ſo much as in you lieth obey the wil of God, but rather fighting againſt God and your owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, do moſt wickedly &amp; ſhamefully ſlaunder the moſte holy ſeruaunt of God: for hitherto you do yours, and the worke of that ſpirite who hath wholy poſſeſſed you long agoe. But God neuertheleſſe doth performe a moſt iuſte worke by theſe your barkings, &amp; that whiche you do moſt wickedly, and that he leaſt will and alloweth of al others, in aſmuch as it iſſueth from you, this ſelfe thing he moſte iuſtly willeth &amp; alloweth, but vtterly in another reſpect, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is, foraſmuch, as he by this mean trieth out his Church, and daily more and more kéepeth his ſeruants with buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fets in modeſtie and humilitie, or ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gthneth him to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeueraunce, reuengeth the vnthankefull worlde, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, bringeth thée with thine to his iuſt iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, except it be, that you had rather at the laſte repent. But if thou compare theſe things with that whiche we haue ſaide to be namely acceptable to God, that ſuche as his ſeruaunte is, ſuch he be taken of good men, thou ſhalt find, that theſe
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:13650:70"/>things be no more repugnant, betwéene themſelues, than when the Lord willeth and commaundeth, at one, and the ſame time, the South winde, to gather the clouds, which ſhould be diſperſed of the Northeaſt, or a rocke in the ſea to be beaten with contrarie windes.

Therefore Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cophant, albeit this place of Ezechiel were not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to be taken, than thou thinkeſt, yet it ſhoulde not make againſt vs. For neither ſay we that Idolatry is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to GOD, albeit by his iuſte iudgemente hée will, and alſo bringeth to paſſe by Satan and what ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer inſtrumentes hée will, that thoſe who haue refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the trueth,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.21. and further.</note> ſhoulde embrace falſehoode, and finallye might breake out into whatſoeuer filthyneſſe.

For neyther he that ſpeaketh ſo, as the Lorde doeth in thys place, doeth eyther commaunde or permitte any thyng, but rather with a moſt ſharpe ſcoffe, doeth vpbraide the falſehoode and vnthankefull mynde, that if it maye be, they whych are reproued may at the laſt with ſhame returne into the waye. The lyke kinde of ſpeaking the LORDE vſed, when Iudas euen nowe being at<pb n="135" facs="tcp:13650:71"/>hande, hée ſayde to his Diſciples ſléeping and in vayne, béeing ſo often warned to watche and pray, ſléepe, &amp; take your reſte.

                     <p>There remaineth a thirde, that he ſuffer ſomething to come to paſſe, whiche he willeth it be either done or not done, as that be careth not whether it be done or no. But who knoweth not that this doctrine is Epicurious? Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, who I praye thée, beſides thée alone, knoweth not, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> omnipotencie of God ſtandeth not only in this, that be can do what he liſte, but in this alſo, that all the power and ſtrength of all inferioure cauſes dependeth of him? But whence is this ſtrength, but from a willing God? For neither can it be wreaſted from the beginning, neither procéede nor iſſue, as out of the hands of an ydle God, that inferior cauſes ſhoulde be enforced, not by his, but by their owne determination. For I denye not, but that the inſtruments are in déede enforced, which are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deued wyth will, according to their owne liking, but by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is carried to the ende ordained of God.

Doth he ſay, and not do? or ſpeak, and not make good? yea, euen Sathan himſelfe, that lying and vncleane ſpirite, doth reproue thée, in whom, when there wanteth not a thouſand waies to do miſchief, and is ſo great wickedneſſe, as we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not poſſibly thinke, yet he is ſo ſtraightly bridled, that he cannot euen hiſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, excepte the Lord with his voice excite him: and is ſo ſtraightlye fettered, that he cannot moue ſo muche as his finger, but by the Lordes aſſignement.

For he acknowlegeth, that, excepte power bée obtayned of the Lord, he cannot hurt any, be it neuer ſo little: and then when it is gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him of the Lorde, to hurte (for the Lorde giueth hym this power of his owne good will, either, that he may pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the wicked, or allure, recall, trie, and correct his own, as we haue ſhewed before) ſo ofte he féeleth himſelfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to remaine within the determined boundes,<note place="margin">Iob. 1.12. &amp;. 2.5.6 1.

For Gods decrée dependeth further than his diſpleaſure. And it is ſhewed in theſe wordes of the Prophet, that there is no cauſe why the people ſhoulde meaſure the wrath of God, by
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:13650:77"/>the multitude of calamities which they ſuffered. For that the Lorde ſent them a greate parte thereof, not as being angry, he woulde deſtroy them, but contrarily, as thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghe a louing father ſhoulde correct them, that they might retourne themſelues to good life. The Lorde therefore af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his maner, as it were ſome moſte louing father maf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling with his children, teſtifieth, that he is angrye with their frowardneſſe and crueltie, to whom he hadde giuen his children to be corrected, but not deſtroyed, that is, that the Executioners dealte more cruellye with them, than his diſpleaſure could beare.

For whereas thou trifleſt elſewhere, that many things are done againſt the determination of God, as if the iſſue of Gods counſel depended of a condition adiected, and that indéede ſuch as is ſette in oure power, all this the Churche of Baſill oute of the worde of God hath worthily curſed long agoe, for ſacrilegious blaſphemie. And the rather, bycauſe we are entred into this ſpeech, I thinke good to annexe thy words out of that vncleane quaternion of thine annotations vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Epiſtle of Paule to the Romanes, whiche being by good right condemned of the Churche at Baſill, yet thy lykes haue not ceaſed to ſperple throughout all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. I hinke therefore good, I ſay, to recite them, and refell them, bycauſe they belong to this place. Thou ſay eſt, it is eaſie to ſhew, that many things are done againſt the determination which is toyned with condition. The <note place="margin">☞</note> Potter hath determined the chalke to be a veſſell for the kitchin, but that veſſell is cleft in the fornace, contrary to the determination. God had determined to bring all the Iſraelites that he brought out of Egipt, into the lande of Canaan, as Moſes himſelfe ſheweth: and therfore were al baptized into Moſes in the cloude: but bycauſe they would
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:13650:77"/>not aſſaulte the Cananites againſte the determination, they periſhed in the wooddes: and as the Scribes fordidde the counſell of God, in themſelues Luke. <hi>7.</hi> God had vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed King Ezechias to death: but by prayers and godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe Ezechias obtained fiftéene yeres co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination.

And that which the Lorde ſayeth to Moſes,<note place="margin">Number 8.14.</note> ye ſhall not doubtleſſe come into the lande, for which I lifted vp my hand, (y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> is, I ſware) y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> I would place you in it: this I ſay, if thou ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt to make for thée, thou art much deceiued: &amp; by thoſe which we wrote a little before, y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> maiſt eaſily be refelled.

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:13650:78"/>Yet by and by it followeth, that excepte two, none aboue twenty yeares olde, ſhoulde enter into Canaan. What then? verily, yet the LORDE ſayeth, he ſpared the people, to whome he had threatned deſtruction: nor is this to be taken of euerye perſon. The LORDE there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hadde ſworne to the people, that he woulde place them in Canaan: which alſo he didde, albeit they went not in, whiche hadde rebelled: and in déede hée partly pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed ſo the Re belles, as yet he ſhewed mercie to their poſteritie, and abode by his promiſe: but partly he ſo ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed himſelfe mercifull to theſe, as hée iuſtlye puniſhed thoſe, and neuertheleſſe cleared his own faithfulneſſe, as is ſhewed in the. <hi>20.</hi> Chapter of Ezechiel.

                     <p>In the other place, whiche thou citeſt oute of Luke, thou bewrayeſt thy manifeſt &amp; intollerable malice.

And thou thy ſelfe in déede, when in Latine thou diddeſt rather peruert than conuerte, waſte ſomewhat more ſhamefaſte, for ſo thou haſte interpreted.

That remayneth whiche thou alleageſt of Ezechias, of which ſorte of examples thou auoucheſt there mighte be many broughte. It ſéemeth good to rcproue thine igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce with the wordes of Caluine himſelfe: bycauſe (though thou burſt with enuye) of this matter there can be nothing ſpoken neyther more briefly nor more truely,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:13650:79"/>nor more plainly. Thus therfore hée ſaith in that golde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> worke, whoſe true title is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> inſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> chapter of predeſtinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; the prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of God, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 53. &amp; 54. ſection. As when we heare y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God is angry, we may not thinke y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there is in him any diſquietneſſe, but rather thinke that this ſpéeche is taken from our ſenſe, bycauſe God ſéemeth to beare the countenance of one that is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, &amp; angry, ſo oft as he executeth iudgement: ſo may we not conceiue any other thing by the name of repentance, than the alteration of his works: bycauſe men are wont, in changing their workes, to ſhewe that they diſpleaſed them. Bycauſe therfore euery chaunge amongſt men, is the correction of that whiche diſpleaſeth, and correction procéedeth of repentaunce, therefore by the name of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentaunce is ſignifyed that whiche God changeth in his workes. In the mean time, neyther his counſell nor wyl was infringed, nor his affection changed: but that which from euerlaſting he had forſaken, approued and decréed, he proſecuteth with a ſtanding courſe, howſoeuer any ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den chaunge may appeare to the eyes of men. Nor whyle the ſacred hiſtorie reporteth the deſtruction forgiuen to the Niniuites which before was publiſhed, &amp; the proro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Ezechias his life, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> death was denounced, ſheweth what Gods decrées were abrogate. They whych ſo thinke, are deceiued in threatnings: which albeit they ſimplye affirme, yet neuertheleſſe it is to be vnderſtand, that they conceyue in them a ſecrete condition. Why dyd the Lorde ſende Ionas to the Niniuits, who ſhoulde foreſhe we their deſtruction? Why dyd he foretel of death to Ezechias by Eſay? For he coulde haue deſtroyed both thoſe and them, without warning of deſtruction. He ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore weyed another thing, than forknowing their deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, they might beholde it comming euen hard at hand. Verilye he woulde not they ſhoulde be deſtroyed, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:13650:79"/>leaſt they ſhoulde be deſtroyed. Wheras there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he prophecieth that Nineuy ſhoulde be deſtroyed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fortye dayes, it is therefore done, leaſte it ſhoulde pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh. Whereas the hope of longer life is cut off to Ezechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, it is therefore done, that he might obtayne by requeſt a longer life. Who ſéeth not now y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Lord by ſuch like threatnings woulde awake them to repentaunce, whom he feareth, that they might eſcape the iudgement whiche their ſinnes had deſerued? If that be ſo, the nature of things inforceth vs thither, that in a ſimple denuntiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we vnderſtande a ſecrete condition, which alſo we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme by like examples. The Lorde reprouing the king Abimelec, bycauſe he had take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from Abraham his wife,<note place="margin">Gen. 20.</note> vſeth theſe wordes: Beholde thou ſhalte dye, for the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man whom thou haſte taken, for ſhe is the mans wife. And after that he had made excuſe, he ſayeth thus: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore the man hys wife, for he is a Prophete, and he ſhall pray for thée that thou mayſte liue. But if not, knowe that thou ſhalte dye the deathe, and all that thou haſte. Séeſt thou that by the firſt denunciation he might ſtrike hys minde the more vehementlye, to the ende he mighte make him carefull to reſtore: but by the other he plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manifeſteth his will? When the like reaſon is of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, infer not vpon them, that anye thing of the former counſel of the Lorde is diſanulled: bicauſe he hath made fruſtrat y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced.

For we ſay not ſimply, that the wil of God doeth come in betwixt in theſe things which be euil, but we adde two things. One is, that the will of God doth ſo come in betwéen euen in theſe things, yet as in no caſe he allow, or do work in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in that they be euil but as they be y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> puniſhments of other euils, or elſe by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Lord executeth his, in déed ſometimes ſecret, but yet always iuſt iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts.

Of both we haue ſayd already verye many things. Yet I will in fewe wordes repeate ſome of them, that at the laſte I may ſatiſfie thée. When the Lorde would puniſh the adultrey of Dauid, beholde ſayth he, I will ſtirre vp againſte thée euill out of thine owne houſe, and I will take thy wiues in thy ſight, and I will giue them to thy neyghbour, and he ſhall ſléepe
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:13650:87"/>with thy wines in the ſight of this ſunne. For thou didſt it in ſecrete, but I will do this thing before all Iſrael, and before the ſunne it ſelfe. But ſaye Sycophant hée that doeth theſe (and the Lorde doth all theſe iuſtly, nor is the authour of inceſt,<note place="margin">Iſal. 33.1.</note> but he iuſtly puniſheth adultrey and murther) doth he ſéeme to thée not to put in his wyll betwéene? When thou ſhalte ceaſe to ſpoyle, ſayeth the Lord, thou ſhalt be ſpoyled. And doth not the Lord ſéeme to them to haue giuen ouer willinglye ſpoylers into the handes of other ſpoylers? If thou dareſt denye thys, the Lorde himſelfe ſhall refell in the ſame Prophete Eſaye, ſpeaking to the Medes and Perſians,<note place="margin">Iſai. 13.3.</note> by whome he had determined to ſpoyle the Babilonians, the ſpoylers of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Iewes. I haue giuen commandement to my holy ones, and haue called the mightie to my wrathe. But what? when the Lorde ſayde to Satan, Beholde, whatſoeuer things Iob hath, are in thy power, did he decrée nothyng: and a little after did Iob ſpake blaſphemie, when ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing diſpiſed the roberie of Satan and the Chaldeis, hee ſayde, The Lorde gaue, and the Lord hath taken away? And when the Lord ſayth, that it will come to paſſe, that be that ſtryketh with the ſworde, ſhall periſhe with the ſworde, doth he not ſéeme to thée to ſpeake of thoſe iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which he willingly executeth by the handes of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, yea euen whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one ſpoyler ſpoyleth another. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the will of God, and that iuſſe and holy commeth in betwixt, both then alſo when men do euill, and therefore haue iuſt puniſhmente. But I thinke it good to cyte the verye wordes of Caluine, not named, as thou haſt done, but whole, that I may ſet out to all men to be ſéene thy ſingular malice &amp; impudencie. In thoſe things which are already come to paſſe, many do eſtéeme the prouidence of God wickedly &amp; moſt vnworthily. All things y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are done, haue reſpect to the order of the diuine prouidence. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:13650:87"/>neyther theftes, nor adulteries, nor murthers are committed, but the will of God commeth in betwixte. Why do they therefore ſaye the théefe ſhall be puniſhed, whych hath deſpoyled him, whom the Lorde wil chaſtice by pouertie? Why ſhal the murderer be puniſhed, which killed him, whoſe life the Lorde had ended? If all theſe obey the will of God, why ſhall they be puniſhed? Thus farre Caluine hath ſpoken in the perſon of the Lyber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynes, in which matter thou bewrayeſt ſuch lewdneſſe as hath not bene hearde of, whyche attributeſt to Caluine himſelfe, which being ſpoken in the perſon of the Lyber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines, in the ſame place he afterwards refuteth in theſe wordes. For he addeth theſe: but indéede I denye, that they obey the will of God. For we ſaye not, that he whyche is caried with an euill minde, doth yéelde his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie to God commanding, ſéeing he only obeyeth his wicked affection. He obeyeth God, who being informed of his will, endeuoureth to that ende whereto he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of the ſame. And whence are we inſtructed, but out of his worde?

And by and by, here truely it may eaſily be gathered, howe vaine and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant that defence of diuine tuſtice is. That thoſe things whiche be euill, are not done by his will, but only by his

Truely, for as much as they are euil which are done of men with an euill minde (as I will ſet down more plainely anone) I graunt they do in no caſe pleaſe God. But whereas they fayne that he ſuffereth thoſe thinges being idle, whyche the Scripture pronounceth to be done, not only with his will, but he being authour, is too fryuolous a ſhifte.

For I will gratifye thée, and alleage another like place out of Caluines booke againſte the Lybertynes, Chap. <hi>14.</hi> The Lord (ſayth he) is highly diſpleaſed, when we ſuppoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> any thing procéedeth from any other place, and do not beholde him, that we may acknowledge him, not only as the chiefe cauſe of al, but alſo as authour, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining by his counſel al things by this or that mean. So therfore let vs co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude, as wel proſperity as aduerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, Raines, Windes, Hayles, Froſt, faireneſſe, abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, famine, warre, &amp; peace be the workes of God: &amp; the creatures, which be inferiour cauſes, be only inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts whyche he hath in vſe to execute his will, and therefore, that he vſeth them as he pleaſeth, turneth them whyche waye ſoeuer he will, and bringeth them to that poynte, that it may altogyther be performed that he hath deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myned. Theſe be Caluins words, whiche if thou takeſe, as if he ſayd, that God were the authour of wicked acts, or willeth ſinne, thou certainely excéedeſt all impudency, ſéeing Caluine in thoſe places confuteth that ſame blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie.

Caluine doeth not teache, that wicked actes are committed, God eyther be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing willing or the author of them: but he teacheth that whiche is moſte true, albeit the euil inſtrument ſinne by cauſe he worketh with a depraued will, yet God doth nothing leſſe than ſinne, when he worketh well by an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill inſtrumente, and that he is the authour of this hys moſte holy worke. So by Satan and the wicked, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually exerciſeth and confirmeth his Churche. So, ſo ofte as he pleaſeth, he reuengeth the wicked, by the hands of the wicked.

<pb n="174" facs="tcp:13650:91"/>the will of the omnipotent God remaineth alwaies inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted which can neuer be euill, bycauſe alſo when it ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth euill, it is iuſte, and verily, that whiche is iuſt is not euill. Beholde the firſte parte of thy ſlaunder plentifullye, truely, and plainely manifeſted. Now I come to the other wherein thou doeſt maliciouſlye imagine, that Caluine teacheth, that the will of God is often contrarye to his commaundement. I will firſte ſpeake of the matter it ſelfe, then I will ſhewe Caluins wordes, that euery man maye knowe thine impudencie, in deprauing them. We graunte, that the Lorde in the table of the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, and the explication thereof, hath plainely and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply manifeſted to vs his will, ſo muche indéede as maketh to the leading of a godlye and innocent life. Yet I ſaye thou arte braineleſſe and ſtarke madde, if thou thinkeſt that all the will of God is comprehended in his lawe. For what? Doth not the frée redemption by Chriſt appertaine to his will. Yet is there of this benefite no mention in his lawe. For the declaration of this law, belóngeth to the other parte of the diuine worde, whiche is called the Goſpell. But while we ſpeake ſo, do we attribute to God two wills, and thoſe repugnant by dircete contrarye? For theſe be contraries, <hi>Except thou do al theſe things, thou ſhalt dye the death: and albeit thou doe them not, yet, if thou doeſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, thou ſhalt liue.</hi> Yet God forbid, that we ſhoulde at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to God two willes, muche leſſe contrarie, ſéeing the will of God is euer one, moſte ſimple and like it ſelfe. For the LORDE neuer gaue his lawe with that wil, that by it he mighte ſaue vs, but rather that thereby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conuicte of vnrighteouſneſſe, he mighte bring vs to CHRIST. Nor doeth the Goſpell aboliſh righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe by the lawe, but that whiche we finde not in oure ſelues, it teacheth to be fréely imputed in Chriſte by
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:13650:91"/>Faith: Thou ſéeſt therefore, that there are not ſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghte twoo willes, where there appeared two, nor that there is repugnaunce there, where appeared to be chiefe. I wil procéede. If thou thinkeſt that thou knoweſt what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer GOD will, nor that there is ouer and aboue. anye ſecreate will of GOD, ſay, I praye thée, what ſhall befall to thée or mée to morrowe by the will of the Lorde. Prophecie howe long the Lorde wil ſuffer, that thou ſhalte waſte the Churche of GOD. Or if thou like not to teltheſe, foreſhewe by thy <hi>Sybilles,</hi> whiche I heare thou arte wonte to preferre before the holyeſt Prophets themſelues, as more worthye and euident, whyche of the two Kings ſhall conquere, <hi>Henry</hi> or <hi>Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip.</hi> For if thou wilte accompliſhe this, and thou ſhalte eaſilye doe it, if there be no ſecreate will of God aboue thy reach, thou ſhalt deliuer many miſerable mortal men of greate care and heauineſſe: and that whiche thou mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſérablye gapedſt for long agoe in vaine, thou ſhalte by and by gette thy ſelfe a greate name. It rayned with vs this daye in the morning. the reſt of the day was faire y nough. Let vs ſet of the contrary, that in the ſame inſtants it was faire at Paris when it rayned here, and that it rayned when it was fayre here. All theſe things came to paſſe by the determination and will of GOD. Are there therefore togither in hym twoo willes, and thoſe indéede contrarye? But doe not you Sycophantes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge at the laſte, howe ſottiſhe, howe fooliſhe, and ridiculous you are? For when we ſaye, that there is a certaine will of GOD reuealed to vs, but ſays alſo, there is a ſecreate will, by and by with greate laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, you for ſuche ſage and reuerent menne doe aſke, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be two wills in God, and howe we knowe this
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:13650:92"/>ſecrete will. As thoughe in déede when we ſaye ſo, it bée not ſufficiently apparant, that we ſaye not anye other thing, than that the will of God, that is, his eternall coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells, be partely manifeſted to vs, ſo much as concerneth our health, as Paule witneſſeth Act. <hi>20.</hi> that he had ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the counſell of God to the Epheſians, that he might ſhutte vppe all the waye to falſe doctrine: but partely yet to remaine ſecrete, that is, foraſmuche, as according to his infinite wiſedome and power, hée hath decréed manye things, and dayly executeth, whiche excéede all the capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and vnderſtanding euen of the Angells themſelues, muche more of miſerable Dwarffs, and ſo much the more oughte rather to be religiouſly reuerenced, than curiou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlye ſearched. But if thou doeſt not acknowledge this to be true, thou arte more than ſenſeleſſe and ſtarke madde. Yea in the ſelfe ſame doctrine, whiche he hath manifeſted to vs. Howe many things be there, whereof we maye in no caſe doubt, and yet whereof, if thou endeuoureſt to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter conſideration, thou doateſt no leſſe, than if thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt, comprehende God himſelfe?

                  <p>For ſéeing it is an aſſured truth, that God hardeneth whome he will, and that this will cannot be withſtoode, if thou aſkeſt howe therefore God is not in the faulte, thou ſhalt ſhew which in déede is the truth, that men be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently conuinced with the teſtimonie of their owne conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but bycauſe that reaſon cannot ſatiſfie mans iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is of neceſſitie, that thou ſay with Paule, O man, who arte thou that conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deſt againſt God?<note place="margin">Rom. 9.20.</note> And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou haſte reaſoned many things of theſe miſteries of God, if will be of neceſſitie,<note place="margin">Rom. 11.33.</note> that thou crye out with Paule, O the déepeneſſe of the riches bothe of the wiſedome and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

For howe often worketh the Lord by euill, and therefore ſinning inſtruments: albeit the actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s themſelues of their owne nature be ſinnes, yet in reſpecte of God working, they are no ſinnes, but the puniſhments of ſinnes, wherewith either the Lorde reuengeth ſinnes paſte, or prepareth his to patience, or doth both togither. Therefore God euen then, when he ſéemeth to will ſinne, which yet he hathe forbidden in the Lawe, cannot ſéeme vnlike himſelfe, yea rather he ſheweth himſelfe ſuch a one as the lawe doth ſet him forth to vs, that is, a ſeuere puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſher and reuenger of wickedneſſe. But no manne (in my iudgement) hathe more plainelye ſhe wed this thing, than Caluin, and verily in that very place which thou though-teſt beſt to reprehend.</p>
                  <p>There is not (ſaith he) anye cauſe, why anye manne

And by &amp; by, of a trueth, (ſaieth he) when Paule cryeth out: O the Profunditie, he plainely teacheth, that there was ſome other iudgement of God concerning the Iewes, than is expreſſed in Chriſtes words: Ieruſalem how often would I haue gathered thy children togither. And whereas hée woulde not the ſonnes of Hely ſhoulde obey their father, that will differed from the precept of the Lawe, wherein he commaundeth children to obey their parents. But this is the place, of whiche thou haſte patched thy ſlaunder, and indéede with apparant lewdeneſſe. For, for to differ from the precept of the lawe, thou haſte placed, to fighte againſte the precept of the Lawe. But thoſe things whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che do differ in themſelues, doe not yet of neceſſitie rebell one againſte an other? as in this kinde: Frowardneſſe doeth not fight againſte obedience, inſomuche indéede, as God willeth it. For God willeth not, that the ſonnes of Hely ſhoulde be rebells againſt their father, as beholding and allowing this rebellion in it ſelfe, but rather by this meanes making waye to his iuſte iudgement. But do theſe fyghte betwéene themſelues, and not rather eſpeciallye accorde in themſelues, to commaunde, that obedience be ſhewed to parentes, and to puniſhe thoſe that rebell againſte that precepte, wyth another rebellion, that they may reape their iuſte puniſhement at the laſte? Further, leaſte I ſéeme to thée to flie to ſubtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, lette vs heare what expoſition Caluine giueth of thys ſaying, leaſte thou mayſte complaine of darkeneſſe or of doubtfulneſſe.

He ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horreth adulteries and inceſtuous coniunctions. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Abſolom defileth hys fathers Concubine be ſore the people, is it done with the will of God? But hée hadde foretolde by his ſeruaunt Nathan, that he woulde doe thys. I will take (ſaith he) thy wiues before thine eyes, and will giue them to thy neighboure, who ſhall lye with them in the ſighte of this ſunne. Thou diddeſt it ſecreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, but I wyll doe it before all the people, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſunne. The Scripture is full of ſuche ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples. Shall wée therefore, either impute to GOD the guiltineſſe of ſinne, or ſhall wée coine a dubble will in him, that hée maye bée at oddes wyth himſelfe? God forbidde. But as I haue ſhewed alreadye, that hée willeth the ſame thing with the wicked and vngodlye, but in a diuers ſorte: ſo nowe is to be obſerued what thinges be diuers in ſorte, that he willeth in like manner, that in this varietie whiche ſéemeth to oure mindes, the Harmonye maye be well ordered. Foraſmuche, as the grieuous offence of Abſolom is ſauage impietie againſt hys father, the treacherous violation of Wedlocke, yea, the filthy Prophanation of the order of Nature, doe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedlye diſpleaſe GOD, who is pleaſed with Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtie, Chaſtitie, Faith, and Modeſtie, who wyll haue the lawfull order whiche he hathe preſcribed to bée amongeſt menne reuerenced and kepte inuiolate.

But what can be in themſelues more repugnant, than to preſerue life, and to kill? peace and warre; but yet with one and the ſelfeſame will, yea euen in one reſpecte, good Princes ſometimes will them both.

He ſendeth Iſay, who ſhould require of the people amendment of life, yet he blindeth the people, that ſeeing, they ſhoulde not ſée. He dayly calleth many, whome yet he draweth to himſelfe. This thou ſayeſt is your doctrine, I graunte, for ſo we
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:13650:97"/>haue learned to ſpeake out of the word of God, but we for al that, denie God to be a diſſembler, for to command, and to nill are not contraries, but theſe in déede are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries, to commaunde and forbidde, to will and to nill, therefore God ſhoulde then haue bin a diſſembler, if hée ſhoulde haue commaunded Pharao to let the Iſraelites go, and ſhould haue letted Pharao that he ſhould not obey it, when he was readie to obey: or if he ſhoulde ſay to the vnbeléeuers, I wil, that you repent, and in the meane, in not drawing them, ſhould bidde them be retchleſſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.

For the cauſe of ſin is in our ſelues, but at what time, and againſt whom it ought to breake out, it is in the power of God, which inſtilleth, not a new malice, but according to his infinite wiſedome, when and howe it pleaſeth him, he moueth, <note place="margin">☜</note> gouerneth, bendeth, guydeth, and finally ordereth to the aduauncement of the glory of his owne name, that whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is bred in men, euen the wicked not knowing of it, &amp; ſo much the rather determining a quite contrary counſel with themſelues.

<pb n="206" facs="tcp:13650:108"/>of God in this argument which we handle, which it remayneth that we confirme with the authoritie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word of God and the fathers.

Finally for that the Scripture manifeſtly calleth the wicked,<note place="margin">Pſal. 205.95.</note> a rodde, a hammer, a ſawe, an axe, which in the hande of God is appoynted and hurled, not ſo in any wiſe as if me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were diſburthened of blame, or as if men had digenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into logges and blockes, but that we may know the prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of God not to be idle in any caſe. Otherways why ſhoulde God call Nabucadnezer his ſeruaunte, and for that cauſe alſo haue ſcourged him, bycauſe he called the ſubuertion of Ieruſalem his work. But what? when the kings harte is ſayde to be in the hande of the Lorde,<note place="margin">Prouerb. 21.1.</note> that he inclyneth it whether ſoeuer he will, is it not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly proued, that we ſaye, that God doth ſtirre vp e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the wicked affections, not in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> they are euill, but in much as he hath determined to vſe them well?

And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thou ſhouldeſt not thinke that we haue firſt taught thus out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word of GOD, heare what Auguſtine hath written of theſe things.

But Auguſtine ſheweth that god doth not only leaue, but alſo declare his wrath &amp; power. Iulianus ſaith, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> theſe ſpéeches are beyond al cre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dite,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:13650:109"/>Auguſtine will, that they be appertinent. Iulianus ſayth, they were burdned before with their doſires, what néede was it, that they ſhoulde be giuen ouer to them? But Auguſtine ſaith, doeſt thou thinke one thyng to haue luſtes, and to be giuen ouer to them? For they are giuen ouer to their luſtes, not y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they may haue them, but alſo that they may vtterly be poſſeſſed of them. Therfore (ſaith he) eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as God worketh in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bodies of the wicked by afflicting them, ſo alſo he worketh in their mindes, by ſending them headlong into ſinne.

God ſaith Auguſtine, iuſtly inclined his will, which was dehraued by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> own fault, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he might rayle vpon Dauid. And there is adioyned a cauſe, the Lord ſhal render me good things for this curſe.<note place="margin">Li. of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt. of Saincts, cap. 20.</note> The ſame Auguſtine ſaith in an other place: whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (ſaith he) God willeth that that thing be done, which may not be done but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men be willing, he togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inclineth their harts that they be willing: &amp; not only worketh in the hartes by aſſiſting,<note place="margin">Of grace and freevvil, to Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent. cap. 20.</note> but euen by iudgyng, that they may performe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thing which purpoſed no ſuch thing, which his hand &amp; counſell hath decreed.

So, many of the ſainctes, long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe by the commaundement and will of God himſelfe, haue fallen, and continually doe fall into moſte grieuous temptations: but with theyr greate profitte, and by no faulte of God, as the ſamctes themſelues confeſſe. So, an euill ſpirite from the Lorde exaſperateth Saule: and there is no doubt, but this ſpirite enforced him headlong into thoſe horrible euils. Did therefore the Lorde tempt Saule, that is, ſolicite him to euill? No, in no wiſe, but he exerciſed Saule with iuſte puniſhments. For the euill procéedeth from the beginning, &amp; of the euil inſtruments, and the good whiche is drawne out of the very euill is al due to God. Finally therfore, as a certain right learned writer hath noted, God tempteth not, that is, in that forte, that the Diuell and wicked men are wont to te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt. And the reaſon is, that God is not tempted of euill, For
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:13650:111"/>hée that tempteth an other to euill, is firſte himſelfe temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and ouercome of euill. The Diueli therefore and wicked menne doe tempte, that is, thinking wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, and hauyng foreſette a wicked ende to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, they make ſharpe their lewdeneſſe, and enforce to euil. But God tempteth vs to an other ende, that wée may vnderſtand oure infirmities, or our ſtrength, that wée maye fall into ſome great calamitie, and ſo maye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne to repent, that finally, when it is requiſite, he maye puniſh ſinnes with ſins, and with other iuſt puniſhments. He that ſaith this, Selaunderer, doth he attibute to God that whiche belongeth to our concupiſcence? But there remaineth a queſtion, why Iames making no mention of Sathan, ſhoulde ſaye, that we are tempted of our luſte. Indéede, bycauſe that, albeit Sathan coth ſollicite vs, and ſome do pricke forwards others, yet all theſe appertaine to that ende, that the concupiſcence whiche is in vs, maye be kindled. And this interior motion is the true &amp; proper beginning of our affections, and therfore of our actions. Séeing then, that Adam, albeit the Diuell prompting him, yet, in the beginning didde depraue himſelfe of his owne accorde and properly, and men be gotten of him, doe in like ſorte properly, &amp; of their own accorde, moue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with this wicked concupiſcence, and become day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worſe than themſelues, why ſhould they lay anye fault vppon God, ſéeing they cannot properly accuſe euen Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than or any other, thoughe fellowes of theſe miſchiefes, yet as the cauſes of their deſtruction?

He therefore expreſſing thoſe ſelfe ſacred wordes: <hi>And leade vs not into temptation.</hi> The name of Temptation, ſaith he, is often vniuerſallye taken for whatſoeuer tryall: in whiche ſenſe it is ſaide, that Abraham was tempted of God. when his faith was
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:13650:112"/>tryed. So we are tempted as well by proſperous as ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe thinges, bycauſe, by this occaſion, the affections come to light, which before laye hid. But here is obſecued the interior affection, whiche maye well be called the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels Bellowes, to ſtirre oure concupiſcence. For it were an abſurde thing, to deſire of God, that hée woulde make vs frée from all the documentes of Faith. Therefore al e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill motions which ſolicite vs to ſinning, are comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vnder the name of Temptation. And foraſmuche, as it cannot be, but we ſhall ſuffer ſuche prickings in oure minds, bycauſe, in the whole courſe of oure life, we haue a ſtanding warfare with the fleſhe, we yet aſke of the Lorde, that he do not proſtrate vs, or ſuffer vs to be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with Temptation. And to the end that Chriſte might better expreſſe, that we depende inclinable to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall caſualties and falles, except God ſuſtain vs wyth his hande, he hath vſed this kinde of ſpeaking, <hi>Leade vs not into temptation,</hi> or as others expound it, <hi>Carrie vs not.</hi> It is in déede verye certaine, that euerye one is tempted of his owne concupiſcence, as Iames teacheth: but by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God doth not onely yéelde vs to Sathans luſte, that he maye kindle the fire of concupiſcence, but he vſeth that inſtrument of his wrath, ſo ofte as he will enforce menne headlong into deſtruction, alſo he leadeth in his maner in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to temptation. In this ſenſe is the euill ſpirite from God ſaid to haue taken Saule, &amp; to that end ſound many places of Scripture.

Firſt of all, the place of Paule which thou citeſt, thou doſt manifeſtly wreſte, for neither doeth it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine to anye parte of men alone, but in like ſort euecy one withoute exception. Paule with this worde of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice condemneth euery man, not ſo much as one excepted. For al, inſomuche as they are the children of Adam, and wythoute Chriſte, (and in this reſpecte they are conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of Paule in this place) are holden conuict of that crime whereof Paule reaſoneth, bycauſe there is not ſo much as one whych doth either honour God, or helpe his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boure by the preſcription of that knowledge whyche partelye GOD hathe engrauen in the mindes of men,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:13650:116"/>and partelye propoſeth to all by the contemplation of the creatures. This is the naturall expoſition of Paules wordes, as appeareth by the order and concluſion of the whole diſputation. But to what ende bée all theſe, to that whereof we deale? For is not God therefore of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with the wickedneſſe of men, bicauſe hée vſeth it well, bothe to the comforting of the godly, and to the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting of the vngodlye? Furthermore, whereas thou pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt of the miniſtring of affections, why doeſt thou wreſt it againſte vs, whiche teache no other thing, but that GOD doeth iuſtlye and wiſely, moue, encline, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne, and bring to the ende whyche hymſelfe determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, euen wicked willes? (for that whiche I haue already ſaide nowe a thouſande times) wée place the whole lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and deſarte, bothe affections and actions, as it is méete in the wicked and Eclipſed beginnings. Therefore thou ſtriueſt not againſte vs, but agaynſte thine owne ſhadow. But now how ſottiſh, how falſe, and howe wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked be thoſe thinges whiche thou addeſt? For firſt thou affirmeſt, that men are guiltleſſe before lewde affections: bycauſe (ſaiſte thou) ſinne is of wicked affections. But when thou ſaiſte theſe things, arte thou not a playne Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagian? For ſay how are we borne the children of wrath, yea, howe we are conceiued in iniquitie, howe we haue néede of the badge of remiſſion of ſinnes, and newe birth, that is, Baptizme euen from our beginning, if there be no ſinne but of wicked affections, nor that wée are guiltie &amp; the children of wrath before we trauell with wicked affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions? But if theſe thinges be true (as they are moſte falſe) from whence ſhoulde wicked affections ſpring? euen by wicked education, by imitation, finallye, by vtter frée will, whiche doth then firſte of all enthrall it ſelfe in euerye manne vnto ſinne, when they begin to boyle with wicked affections. Therefore men ſhould haue no néede of
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:13650:117"/>grace regenerating, ſéeing ſinne is not by propagation, if they would follow nature. And arte thou not aſhamed, (moſte filthie Dog) to diſpute of Chriſtian religion, which renueſt vnto vs afreſh theſe reaſtie poyſons of Pelagius, but rather arte thou worthye with theſe monſters, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou ſhouldeſtſée this lighte?

If (ſayſt thou) Caluines ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence be true, the wrath of God is reuealed againſte all thoſe that be guiltleſſe. Lo, thou lyeſt agayne Sclaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, for ſo farre it is off that Caluin be allyed to this blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie, that contrarily he doth not indéede aſſent to them, whiche will only haue the nature of man to be hurte and wounded, &amp; which alſo deny that concupiſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in the rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate is ſin.

But euen that whiche thou ſayeſt is not ſimply and alwayes true, that is to ſay, that God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth them, whoſe wicked affections he moueth. For the Lord loued Paule from euerlaſting, and yet ſo long as it pleaſed him, he incyted and ſharpned by Sathan his madneſſe and crueltie, till he might haue mercie vppon him, and louing him, might declare to him whiche was plunging headlong into eternall deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that his will whereby he ſeparate him from his mothers womb.

This laſt ſaying of Caluine, thou Sclaunderer haſt ſnatched, that thou myghteſt perſuade menne, that Caluine hathe foredone euen all difference of good and euill, or maketh God the authoure of wickedneſſe.

It is not you (ſayeth he) but the Lorde that ſente me before, that I myghie nouriſhe you. It appeareth therefore when they dyd wickedlye, that yet God wroughte by them, that they myghte fynde lyfe in deathe. As muche as was in them they had ſlayne theyr brother, thence dothe lyfe ſhyne vnto them. The ſame is to be ſéene in Sathan the Prince of all wickedneſſe, and head of all wicked men.

But there ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to me to be another queſtion, and that aparte, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any bone of his could be broken, for it was requiſite of neceſſitie, that they all remayne whole and vnhurte, bycauſe it was ſo determined by the immoueable decrée of God. But I ſpeake not ſo as of the cuſtomarie kindes of ſpeaking of neceſſitie by his meane or abſolute.

Therefore, if in the bones of Chriſte thou conſider nature, they were brittle, but if thou conſider the decrée whiche was manifeſted in his time, they were no more endaungered to breaking, than the Angels to the miſeries of men. But now ſéeyng it ſtandeth vs on to beholde the order of nature diſpoſed from aboue, I do in no ſort reiect caſualtie, as it apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyneth to our ſenſe.

In déede, the ſeconde cauſes, ſéeing they are diuers, they oft times hinder themſelues, which we ſée doth come in vſe in the paſſages of Heauen, that ſome be hindered of others. But the will of God can be hindred by no force. But once he allowed the Iewiſh Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, afterwardes he willed them to be abandoned. Howe then is not the prouidence of GOD changeable?</p>
                  <p>I aunſwere, that there is in GOD altogither one and the ſelfe ſame will, but that he foreſawe from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting what was conuenient for diuers times.

Then <hi>Vinditianus,</hi> it is no maruell (ſaith he) for I gaue thée not that. Here when others maruelled, and thought that he had vſed to adde ſome magical force, there is (ſaith he) no ſuch thing: he is of another age, &amp; hath other humors, than who I dyd firſte giue him that potion. But for that cauſe ſhall the Phiſicke be inconſtant: So vtterly God, albeit he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſéeth all thinges, yet he hath not decréed, that all thinges ſhall be done at one time. Now let vs come to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it ſelfe, if the prouidence of God be certaine, may it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any chaunce: Here firſt I wil vſe two diſtinctions, and then I wil anſwere.

Other thinges he neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie by ſuppoſition, as that which is taught in Schooles, that whiche is, in ſomuch as it is, is neceſſarie. Chriſte and the Prophets preach, that Ieruſalem ſhal be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, therefore it ſhall be deſtroyed of neceſſitie: not bycauſe that neceſſitie is in the nature of the Cittie, but bycauſe Chriſte and the Prophets haue foretolde it, which coulde not be deceiued. There muſt be hereſies (ſaith Paule.) And Chriſt ſaith, It is neceſſarie that offence come. For, theſe cauſes being ſet, that is, the corrupt wits of menne, and the diuels hatred againſt mankind, &amp; the end being ſét alſo, that the elect ſhall be tryed, by ſuppoſition it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie, that theſe things come. Alſo things may be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red two wayes, either as they are ſecreat in the cauſes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:13650:122"/>they ſtande oute in acte, &amp; ſo they haue the reaſon of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity. For they are no more indeterminate, as to write, or not to write, is caſuall. But if thou write alreadie, it is no more caſuall, but of neceſſitie. Therfore we ſay, the knowlege of ſenſes is certaine, bycauſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> very things can not be are themſelues otherwiſe. But alſo things maye be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered as they are ſecret in their cauſes, And for that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cauſes, are ſomtimes of power, ſomtimes not of power to bring forth effects, therfore there is no neceſſary working force in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> things the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues be referred to God, there is a far other reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For he calleth thoſe things whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che are not, as thoughe they were. For bycauſe he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth al time, &amp; hath neither beginning nor ending, alſo all things whiche ſhall be hereafter by time indeterminable, are yet preſent to him.

                     </gap>thing. So, albeit that thinges of their owne nature remayne indifferent vnto bothe parts, yet of GOD they are more inclined into the one. The will of Saule was by hys nature no more enclined to goe, that to tarrye. But when GOD woulde ſend him to Samuell, he beganne to encline his will into the one parte. Therefore GOD ſetteth before his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding the will of his father, and bringeth to paſſe that that mighte vrge, and effectuallye enforce his minde, that all other deſires of flouth and ydleneſſe, if anye were whiche mighte deceiue him, ſhoulde faile. Therefore it came to paſſe, that the will of Saule ſhoulde obey the prouidence of God. Yet, in the meane time, the nature of the thing is not violated, but that the will of Saule was equallye frée to bothe partes. Hence it appeareth what néede we haue of the grace of GOD. For oure will as it is depraued in all reſpectes, it tourneth all into the worſe parte. Alſo there be manye thinges whiche woulde dull and make blinde oure vnderſtanding, that will ſhoulde not eaſilye encline. GOD therefore ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth before oure vnderſtanding that whiche is good: then be kindleth oure confidence, and ſtirreth vppe the dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that we maye will effectuallye. But thou wilte ſay, wherefore is any thing called Caſuall, ſéeing it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready decréed of God into the one parte, and ſo is made of neceſſitie? I aunſwere, euerye thing by his owne proper beginning is caſuall: but the prouidence whyche bryngeth neceſſitie, is a forraine cauſe, from whiche the name ſhoulde not be gyuen to thinges. I knowe there be many that determine thoſe thynges, whiche cannot thereto be brought of God by mans ſtrength, that our wil can either chooſe or refuſe, &amp; that there y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of God
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:13650:123"/>doth ſtay, neyther procéedeth further, and when God fore ſawe what euery one would chooſe, and what refuſe, that his foreknowledge is nothing hindered. But theſe do not ſufficiently accorde with Diuine Scriptures. For they teach, that God doth not ſo prouide for things, that he may leaue them, but as we haue ſayde, that he maye bring them to their determinate endes: And the end<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s themſelues do yéelde loyaltie to the prouidence of God. For thus Paul ſayth, that God hath done all things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> determination of his wyl. So ſayth the lord by Eſay, All things that I wil, I do. And Chriſt ſaythe, That euen a Sparowe doth not fal to the grounde with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the will of our father. I knowe that Origen, Cyrill, Chriſoſtome, and others, when they are preſſed with plaine places of Scripture, of which ſort are, it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie, that Chriſt ſhoulde die: and it was of neceſſitie, that the Scripture ſhoulde be fulfilled, doe ſo interprete theſe things, not that it came therfore to paſſe ſo, bicauſe God did forſée them: but that God did therefore foreſée them, bicauſe they ſhoulde come to paſſe.</p>
                  <p>This ſentence, if it ſhould ſpeake of ſimple knowlege, it coulde not be ſo much reproued. For not bycauſe I ſée one writing, he writeth: but bycauſe he writeth, I ſée him writing. But in God we cannot place a bare know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, will alſo muſt be adioyned which ordereth, and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteth all things. But yet ſhal it be true which they ſay, if it be vnderſtoode of the effect, or as they ſpeake, of the poſterior. For we, by that that any thing is done, do vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that it was Gods counſel that it ſhould be done ſo. Otherwayes the Scriptures do manifeſtly ſpeake. It was neceſſarie, that Chriſte ſhoulde dye. It was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie, that the Scriptures ſhould be fulfilled. But howe was it neceſſarie, that they ſhoulde be fulfilled by ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, bicauſe God had ſo foreſéene it, not bycauſe that
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:13650:124"/>that neceſſitie was in the nature of the thyng. But it may be, thou wilt therefore ſay that the cauſes in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing it ſelfe are infinite, bycauſe, I take not the full and intire cauſes, for that it ſhould haue bene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to ad y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prouidence of god. I anſwere, I only take the interiour and proper cauſes of euery thing, whoſe ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectes bycauſe they might &amp; might not be produced from them, they are caſuals, and not the prouidence from god, for that it is a forraine cauſe, which if it be added, it can not be auoyded, but by ſuppoſition ſome neceſſitie ſhould folowe. For example ſake. Saule met children carrying Kyds, breade and Wine. There will by the ſelfe nature was infinite, cyther that they might haue giuen, or not giuen hym anye thing. But that will GOD by hys prouidence ordered into the one parte. They went to Bethell that they myghte doe ſacrifiſe, they mette Saule wearied in the waye, and preſſed with famyne: it ſéemed a poynte of humanitie to refreſhe him. Theſe thyngs preferred GOD to their myndes, and if, there were any things which might hinder their wil, thoſe hée repreſſed. And theſe things only we diſpute of the willes of men.</p>
                  <p>For in other caſuall things, I knowe there be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite meanes whiche GOD is wonte to vſe. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther example of this matter we haue in the <hi>21.</hi> Chapiter of Ezechiell, Nabuchadnezer moued into Syria, and when he was in a place that ledde two wayes, hée began to deliberate, whether it did not rather leade to the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes, or to Rabath king of the Ammonites: He yéelded y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter to Lottes: thoſe God guydeth, and bringeth him to Ieruſalem. The nature of the thing it ſelf was caſual: but the ſame determyned of GOD, is made neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:13650:124"/>Ioſeph was ſo ſolde and caried awaye into Egipte, as that whiche belongeth to the nature of the thing, hée might eyther alwayes liue in bondage, or in ſome tyme be deliuered. But God ſent dreames vppon the Baker and Cuphearer, and Ioſeph doth expounde them: after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a viſion was ſente vnto Pharao, and when no ſoothſayer coulde expounde it, the Cupbearer put him in minde of Ioſeph, and ſo it came to paſſe, that Ioſephe ſhoulde be broughte out of priſon. Let it therefore bée ſet downe that we haue ofte ſayde, that all things if they be referred to Gods prouidence, are neceſſarie, and of their owne nature caſuall. But thou wilte ſaye, ſhal the effecte be ſimplye called caſuall, or rather of neceſſitie: There bée, which for the dignitye of the prouidence, wil call them neceſſarie. But I hadde rather call them of theyr owne nature caſuall. Albeit I doe not anye thing withſtande it, ſo that that neceſſitye bée only vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtoode of ſuppoſition: the Grecians therefore haue called prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, <gap reason="foreign">

But if it be ſo, how raigned death vpon them which ſinned not after the ſimilitude of Adam: and why doth the Church baptiſe infants, if we be not borne the children of wrath? Giue therefore, wicked Pelagius, glorie to God, and if thou canſt, acknowledge at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> laſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> grace of God, not whereby we were created, that wée might be men, (for this we loſtin Ada<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if thou only excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt this bycauſe we ſinne willingly:) but that whereby we are iuſtifyed, that we might be iuſte men.

But albeit the ſunne beames be all one and the ſame, yet if ſoftneth war, and hardeneth clay. So alſo it commeth to paſſe here. For therefore are admonitions giuen forth, to them that hée elect, that when they knowe their owne miſerable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, they maye runne to him, of whome alone they may be healed. I came not, ſaith Chriſt, that I might cal the iuſt, but ſinners to repentaunce. Alſo, I came, that I mighte ſaue that whiche was loſte.

For that which appertaineth to theſe, there is the effectual working of the ſpirite ioyned with the outward preaching of the word. Therefore as the Lorde ſayth, I haue giuen them preceptes.

Whereas thou ſayſte, that the reiected are wicked before they be, that is, from euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, it is not our doctrine, but the Apoſtles, who wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth, that Eſau was hated (that is, was ordained to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, as we haue ſhewed in his place) before be was born and hadde done anye euill, and that God, as a Potter, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth veſſells of diſhonoure. Therefore this doctrine is true, if in déed thou conſidereſt reprobation in the purpoſe of God: but if thou conſidereſt it, in that it commeth forth alreadie into acte (as they ſpeake) or in that the Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth nowe to execute his determination in effecte, or foreknoweth the execution thereof, it is falſe that thou ſaiſte. For God in effecte reiecteth none, but thoſe that are corrupted in Adam, and with whome therefore hée is worthily diſpleaſed. Whereas thou ſaiſte, that the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates ſinne of neceſſitie, it is not truly ſaid of thée. For the purpoſe of neceſſitie is not the cauſe of that neceſſitie, but Adams ſinne which iſſued forth vppon all men. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as thou ſaiſte, that the reprobates are damned before the precepte, it is falſe in euerie reſpecte: for there is no man
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:13650:129"/>damned, excepte for ſinne. And where there is no lawe, there is no tranſgreſſion. But the lawe giuen to Adam, and tranſgreſſed of him, made all men inthralled to the wrath of God, and therefore to iuſt damnation. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as thou ſayſt, that God damneth men before offence, out of our doctrine it is altogither forged, and dothe bewray thy groſe ignorance. The Lorde predeſtinat to life from euerlaſting whome he pleaſed, yet he ſaueth them not, except iuſtifyed in Chriſt, otherwiſe he ſhould be vniuſt. So alſo he predeſtinate to death fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euerlaſting whome he would, yet he dothe not abandon them to deſruction, except corrupt in Adam, to whiche corruption alſo come the other frutes of contumacie and corruption.

What is therefore thine igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, what madneſſe Sclaunderer, when thou mingleſſ damnation with the purpoſe of reiecting, and in ſome place ſetteſt damnation before the purpoſe of reiecting, that is, the end before the beginning? and art thou not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to diſpute of things vnknowen, and whiche thou vnderſtandeſt not?

Doeſt thou ſée (Sclaunderer) what bée the principles of thy Diuinitie? But goe too, lette vs heare in what Schole thou haſt learned, and wyth what couloures of darkeneſſe thou canſt paynte out the lighte. Thou ſayeſt therefore that God is ſwift to forgiue, and ſlows to wrath. In déede thou geſſeſt truely, ſéeyng thou

But it wyll alſo appeare by and by, that thou peruerteſt thys truth of God, when wée come to the diſpenſation of hys mercie. Thou ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt therefore, that God created the man, from whome all menne ſprong, after hys owne ſimilitude, lyke to hymſelfe, that hée myghte place hym in Paradiſe, and enriche hym wyth an happye lyfe. That thou alleadgeſt of the creation of Man, I graunte, and nature and reaſon myghte after a ſorte dyrecte thée, for it willinglye ſuffereth it ſelfe to bée prayſed and aduaunced. But in the ende of man I diſſente from thée, when eſpeciallye thou conſidereſt not Adam, as ſome ſingular vndeuided thyng, but as the ſhewe of man, bycauſe all menne ſhoulde bée comprchended in hym. And that I maye lette paſſe that fooliſhe dreame of Paradiſe, whyche the vanitie of nature and thy mynde hathe taughte thée, and we haue refuted in hys place, but whence indéede didſt thou learne, ſo to iudge of Gods purpoſe to make man? for thou ſhalte fynde no ſuche thyng in the ſacred Scriptures, but thou ſhalte ſynde this, that God created all things for hys owne glorye, euen the wicked, agaynſte the daye of euill. Therefore thy reaſon and thyne vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandyng hathe taughte thée thys lye, for ſayeſt thou, otherwyſe God ſhoulde bée cruell, and worſe than any Wolfe, if he ſhoulde haue created anye to myſerie. What if I ſhoulde denye that he were cruell, whyche for iuſt cauſes determineth any thyng, albeit it be harde and bitter, ſo that the ſharpeneſſe excéede not the rule of iuſtice?

Howe is it therefore that when the holy Scriptures doe witneſſe, that God created all thynges for his owne glorie, euen the wicked againſte the day of euill, thou contrarilie ſuppoſeſt, that God created all in Adam, to the ende that he mighte enriche them with an happy life? was it for that thou knoweſt not with what cauſes God being moued, ſhould worthilie ordeyne them to miſerie that are not yet borne, forſooth reaſon dothe tel thée this, but moſt fooliſhly, for thou takeſt that which is moſt ſottiſh, and vtterly repugnant to the very nature of God, that is, that God knoweth no reaſon of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, ſo oft as men can not comprehend it. But how much better ſhouldeſt thou haue done, if thou hadſt cauſed na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and reaſon to kéepe themſelues within their bonds, and to haue drawen their reynes ſo ofte, as they durſt kicke againſt the holy Ghoſt?</p>

I thinke he doth, how is it then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thou admitteſt that ordinance, which once being ſet, he can neither be always like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, nor almighty? For if he created all men with that purpoſe that he mighte ſane all, why dothe he not ſane them? is it bycauſe hée wyll not nowe ſane thoſe
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:13650:133"/>whome he made in the beginning? Then he hath changed his will, and hath indéede repented him of his purpoſe. Or is it bycauſe he cannot ſane them? then hée cannot bée al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie. But what manner of godhead is this, whiche is neither alwaies like himſelfe, nor can do whatſoeuer hée will. Finally, ſée howe the latter may agrée with the firſt. Thou ſaidſte, that God was readie to forgine, and ſlowe to wrath. But if his counſell hadde béene ratified, in déede what maner of counſel doeſt thou ſay it was, in reſpect of men there ſhould haue bin no place left to this his nature. Nature and Will therefore doe contend in God. For hys nature is to vſe mercie and wrath, whiche his will ſhoulde not haue ſuffered him to doe. For, what place had there bin, either for wrath or mercie, if he had crowned al men with eternall life in Adam? The truth therefore is thus. Albeit, that the Lorde doth aduance his glorie in manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting both his mercie and wrath: yet ſo he created man, to the end, that in that lining creature eſpecially, he might manifeſt both the one and the other. He therefore created him iuſte, for howe ſhoulde he doe otherwiſe, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togither good? nor otherwaies he coulde haue iuſtely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned euill, if he had bin the Authour of euill: but with that condition, that ſhortely of his owne will (for he was endued with will) and therefore by his owne faulte, hée mighte decline from his creator, and mighte carrie head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long into the ſame ruinous downefall, all thoſe whiche were included in him. But wherfore was this? That hée might ſhewe forth, in ſauing certaine miſerable men, his mercie, and condemning ſome, his wrath, and therefore make manifeſt that his nature in man. But go to, let vs go on, to beholde your Idoll. Thou ſaiſte, that this God willeth, that all men be ſaued. And againe, thou ſéeſte into what downfalles thou arte carried, bycauſe thou ſubmitteſt the word of God to reaſon, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:13650:134"/>thou oughteſt to ſette reaſon in obedience to the worde of God? And lette vs ſée howe finelye this thy reaſon is knitte in argument. God ſhould not be like himſelfe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept euen as in the beginning he would, ſo alſo be ſhould ſane all, after Adams ſinne. But thou auoucheſt that whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che we ſhewe to be falſe of neceſſitie, euen by the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of reaſon. Thou therefore laboureſt to auoide that inconuenience whiche is no where. God ſhoulde be cruel, except he woulde that all ſhoulde be ſaued. But I ſay, that he cannot ſéeme cruell, no not to verye reaſon, albeit hée ſhould haue ſaned not ſo muche as one of Adams poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, ſéeing they haue all deſerued, that they ſhould periſhe. Therefore God is neither inconſtant, nor cruell, albeit he ſane not all. Yea, if he ſhoulde ſane all, he ſhoulde diſſent from himſelfe, as he which neceſſarily (that is his nature ſo requiring) hathe decréed from the beginning for his own glories ſake, to manifeſt in man not onely his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, but alſo wrath, and therefore not to ſaue all, but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.</p>
               <p>Finally, if I ſhould graunt thée this (noble Warrior) I ſhall wrappe thée in thoſe ſnares, wherwith thou waſt incombred a little before. For verily, if he will that all be ſaned, and ſaueth them not in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> time wherein they are to be ſaned, it is the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, bicauſe he hath changed his mind, or elſe, that he cannot. But y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thy guide &amp; Maiſtreſſe doeth teach, that neither of both doth agrée with the nature of God. And if theſe be aſſigned, to what purpoſe is this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous end, leaſt God ſhould ſéeme cruell, if he wil not that ſome one be ſaned, ſéeing the goodneſſe of God ought rather to be admired &amp; maruelled at, which wil, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſo much as one of Adams poſteritie ſhould be ſaned? But it ſhal be labourworth to ſée what teſtimonies of Scripture thou abuſeſt to ſtrengthen this erroure? Firſte therefore thou

Dydde not therefore the Apoſtles either their office, or haue they preached the Goſpell to all men? The Lord is ſaid in Mathew to haue healed and cured all diſeaſes and infirmities in Galiley: but in déede thinkeſt thou, that there was no ſicke folkes beſides, and not rather to be ſignified, that euerie kinde of diſeaſe was cured of Chriſte. Whereas therefore this place and other lyke, are cited of certaine, muche vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to thée, it tendeth not thether, that they woulde ſet downe, that the kingdome of GOD belongeth to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie one, but to this ende rather, that whoſoeuer are toyled in the temptation of particular election, maye knowe that there is an vniuerſall callyng, that is, that all menne, and guiltie of howe greate ſinnes ſoeuer, and in whatſoeuer age, are called of GOD, leaſte bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing feared wyth the conſcience of theyr owne ſynnes, they ſhoulde deſpayre, or ſéeke the declaration of their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> higheſt degrée, that is, in the purpoſe of God, wythout CHRISTE and the voice of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell ſounding in the Churche.

But that other place of Peter which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cyteſt, wherein it is ſayde that God will haue no man periſhe, we haue ſufficiently expounded in the Refutation of the ninth Argumente vppon the firſte ſlaunder. Therfore I come to the thirde teſtimonie. For, thou ſayeſt, God ſent his ſonne into the earth, whoſe righteouſneſſe did ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abounde, whereſoeuer ſinne did abound. Here I can not ynough maruel at thine impudencie. For I reade not in Paule, Whereſoeuer ſinne abounded: but, where ſinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded, that there abounded grace. But indéede the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles purpoſe in theſe words is not to ſhew how large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the benefite of Chriſte extendeth, that is, whether it belong to all or to certaine onelye, but rather to ſhe we this one thing, that the lawe of Moyſes did not therefore excéede the lawe of nature, that any ſhould be iuſtifyed in it: but of the contrarie, that men might the rather be hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den conuict and guiltie: but when men are toyled in that miſerable condition, that the grace of the Goſpell hath appeared which ſhould abounde abone ſinne, and ſhoulde bring the greater benefite to men, by ſo much, how much more was the bondage of ſinne, which had increaſed by the lawe. Who maye not thinke, that thou haſte loſſe al iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of minde, when thou wryteſt theſe, to that end y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thou mayſt prone, that God willeth that al men ſhould be ſaned?</p>
               <p>Now I come to the place of Iohn, wherein thou thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt it is ſayd, that the light of the iuſtice of Chriſt doth lighten all that commeth into this world. But who wyll graunt thée this? For by the name of light, ther, I grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that Chriſte is ſignifyed: but in reſpect of creation, not rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For Iohn deſcribeth the excellency of the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall worde, by whoſe power and goodneſſe ſéeing all things are created, and men themſelues eſpecially beyng
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:13650:136"/>indued with the light of vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding do line, yet bycauſe this light hath ſhined to the blinde, the blinde haue not acknowledged the light. This when Iohn had ſayde in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beginning of the Chapter, afterwardes interſerting mention of Iohn Baptiſt, he vrgeth the ſame in two verſes of the ſame chapter, that is, the ninth and tenth. Then from the beginning of the eleuenth verſe he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to the comming of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>That this is the natural meaning of this place, I hope they will graunt me, whoſoeuer haue diligently weygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoſe things that be ſpoken there. For ouer and abone that this is the order of ſpeach, ſay I praye thée, by what meanes at the laſt wilt thou prone, that they are al light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of Chriſt that come into the worlde? Is it bycauſe they are all made partakers of the grace of Chriſt? But Iohn addeth, that Chriſt was not receiued of his, but of a certaine, who bycauſe they were borne of God, did ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore beléeue. Furthermore, thou canſt not deny, that the benefite of Chriſt is receiued only by faith. But faith co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth by grace, and not by nature, nor is it giuen to all men. All therefore are not lightened of Chriſt, that is, made partakers of the grace of the Goſpell. But wilte thou flée to that vniuerſall preaching of the Goſpel, and wilt ſay, that the light of Chriſt is offered to all, albeit very manye will refuſe it being offered? But euen this could neuer be ſaide of euery man. For tel me, before the comming of Chriſt, howe many yeares paſſed, in which (as Paule ſayeth,) God ſuffered the Gentyles to walke in their own wayes? where was then the light of Chriſt that was to come among the Gentiles? Yet I graunt, that they all had ſo muche light in the meane time, as is ſufficient to make them without excuſe, ſéeing their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience was to them for a law, and by the ſight of viſible
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:13650:136"/>things they ought to haue bene recalled from Idolatrie. But we aſke of the light of the Goſpell, where with thou ſaiſt that all men, that is, euery man, is lightened at the leaſt outwardly. But I affirme, that before the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>myng of Chriſt, the greateſt part of the world was not lighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the beames of this light, neyther inwardly nor outwardly. But after comming to Chriſte, I graunte in déede that the light of the Goſpell was diſperſed into al landes: but arte thou ſo ſottiſhe, that thou thinkeſt that thys benefite belongeth to euery man, and not rather to certaine, that is, to the electe of all people? loke nowe at the leaſt what is the countenance of the world, and ſée how many there be in the vniuerſall compaſſe of the earthe whiche die before they heare neuer ſo little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Is the Lorde therefore cruell? to you in déede, as I ſée, when a certaine felowe euen of thy familiars, in a little booke whiche he publiſhed thrée yeares paſt, of the Largeneſſe of the Mercie of God, had rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende that they are neuertheleſſe ſaned by Chriſte, to whome the Goſpell was not preached, than thinke that ſo manye menne are inthralled to eternall tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes. But we veryly haue learned, not to place healthe anye other where than in Chriſte, nor Chriſte elſewhere but in the faythfull and the faythfuls houſe: ſo farre is it off that therefore we ſhoulde accuſe God of anye cueltye, that of the contrarie we ſay not, that hée is cruell, if he hadde reiected euen all to one, ſéeing we are all by nature the children of wrath. Let vs alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céede further.</p>
               <p>For albeit we ſhoulde not be borne the children of wrath, yet if it ſhould be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wil of God, for the declaring
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:13650:137"/>of his power and wrathe ſake, to create al to deſtruction, let vs reſt ſilent, as it is right, in that will, as in the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne and alone rule of Iuſtice. For what is more iuſte, than, that men iudge that to be truely iuſt and good whiche God doeth, albeit they cannot comprehend hys iudgements. But if be dampne moe than he doeth ſane, he doeth not therefore ſéeme to vs, more readie to wrath, than to mercie, bycauſe the mercie of God by Chriſt, is ſo greate, that albeit it ſhould appertaine to one manne onely: yet, for that it belongeth to vs, this goodneſſe of God ſhall be greater by manye degrées, than his iuſte wrath againſte the reſt. For whereas he is angry wyth ſinnes, he ſéemeth after a ſorte, to doe it of neceſſitie: and whereas euen for the ſafegard of one man, he made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe man, that in verye déede ſéemeth after a ſorte more infinite, than infiniteneſſe it ſelfe. It remayneth, that we conſider that moſte ſwéete voice of Chriſte: Come to me all yée that laboure. Thou thinkeſt that it belongeth to all men, as if Chriſte had inuited euerye one to him. But I except many things. Firſte I ſaye, that Chriſte ſpeaketh as a Miniſter. And this is the office of a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, that bycauſe he knoweth not the ſecreate councells of God, he teache indifferentlye thoſe that are commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his charge, and bid them to the Lord, and ſo much the more, ſo muche as in him lyeth, to wil, that they may be ſaned. But if thou gathereſt thereof, that all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Lords flocke, or that eſpeciall grace to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in like ſorte to all, thou arte wonderfullye deceiued. For the Lorde will, that the Goſpell be preached to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye blinde, to manye deafe, and to manye proude people, that they may more and more be blinded, made deafe, &amp; hardened: nor yet is God therefore an Hipocrite, as we haue proued in his place. Then if this voice of Chriſte appertaine to euery one without exception, to what end

For thy reaſons be darke and almoſte of that ſorte, that the booke being laide aſide, they ſlippe out of memorie by and by, nor can they conuince the aduerſaries. But the aduerſaries arguments are plaine, ſharp, and ſuch as may eaſily be committed to memorie, and be perceiued of the vnlearned, and ſuch almoſte as were they that followed Christe. Hence it commeth that thy Diſciples doe more builde vppon thy aucthoritie, than vppon reaſon. And when they cannot ouercome their aduerſaries, they holde them for here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes and frowarde men. and they ſhun their company, and euerie where moue al men to ſhun them: But I, who thinke it is not to be regarded who ſpeakes, but what is ſpoken, do iudge, that all are to bee hearde, and all things approued, and that whiche is good to be kepte.

But it maye be I am too troubleſome to thée, whileſt I put thée in minde, that thou ſhouldeſt be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.
